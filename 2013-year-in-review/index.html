<p>Adam Fortuna is a developer, crossfitter, foodie who lives in Orlando, FL. He blogs about programming at <a href='http://evaleverything.com'>evaleverything.com</a> and <a href='http://twitter.com/adamfortuna'>tweets</a> often.</p>
</div>
      
      <div class='post-content'>
        
          <p>This is my annual recap of what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last year. I&rsquo;ve come to realize every 5th or 6th year is extremely active, while the other years seem to be less so. This year was not one of those 5/6 years, but instead more about personal growth and finding balance in my life. The biggest parts of my life this year were: Marilyn, Code School, CrossFit, audiobooks, learning Ember.js, and learning Piano.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t travel all that much this year. The biggest trips were Rails Conf and WWDC &ndash; both week long conferences attended with coworkers.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://railsconf.com/">Rails Conf</a> in Portland, OR</li>
<li>Was extremely lucky to attend <a href="/wwdc">WWDC</a> in San Francisco</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/365957862113021952">Sanibel</a> with Marilyn for her birthday weekend</li>
<li>Went to Miami for <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/404414324401520641">Distant Worlds</a>, a Final Fantasy Concert</li>
</ul>


<h2>Events and Entertainment</h2>

<p>The most random event this year was Distant Worlds. Marilyn and I were discussing &ldquo;What musical acts would you absolutely love to see that you haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and I mentioned Nobuo Uematsu, the composer behind the Final Fantasy games. After looking to see if he had a tour coming up, there was one in Miami 2 months out. Considering he&rsquo;s only performed in the US 10 times in 10+ years, we really lucked out!</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>If you like movies, I’d encourage you to create a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> account and friend me!</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Saw a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/year/2013/">load of movies</a>, my favorites for the year being: Somm, Gravity and Stoker</li>
<li>Went to the Florida Film Festival Premiere, followed by seeing a number of awesome movies</li>
<li>Attended Megacon for the 15th straight year</li>
<li>Lots of <a href="/books">audiobooks</a> &mdash; 45 total for the year. My favorites were Hyperion, Maphead, His Dark Materials and Bossypants. Many more were amazing.</li>
<li>The TV Shows I looked forward to most this year were Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Homeland and Breaking Bad</li>
<li>Went to <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/335839768439029761">BarCampOrlando</a> and presented on &ldquo;R Programming for Ruby and Rails Developers&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Postal Service concert viewed from the balcony at Hard Rock</li>
<li>A hilarious Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine concert at House of Blues</li>
<li>Saw Kevin Smith live at the Plaza Theater</li>
<li>Distant Worlds Concert</li>
<li>Only played a few video games, including more Skyrim, Final Fantasy VI, Bioshock and Final Fantasy XII</li>
</ul>


<h2>Body</h2>

<p>2011 was about having fun and keeping interested (when it comes to CrossFit). This year was more about testing my limits and seeing how I could improve. Towards the end of the year I did start to plateau when it comes to working out. I suspect it was due to an awful diet and lack of sleep.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2-years-of-crossfit">Worked out</a> usually around 3 or 4 times a week, nearly always at 8am</li>
<li>Stopped by <a href="http://www.crossfitportland.com/">CrossFit Portland</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/yeabuddy">Casey</a> when in town for Rails Conf</li>
<li>Participated in the <a href="http://evaleverything.com/2013/11/12/xkcd-style-graphs-with-r/">CrossFit Open</a> with a few other people to see how I matched up. My best performance was in the 20% percentile, but most were in the 4%</li>
<li>Continued doing yoga at work on Wednesdays. Great way to relax and prevent injury</li>
<li>Did <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000881.html">Murph</a> in 51:17 for Memorial Day. Confident I can do better next time!</li>
<li>Ran in a <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/297775932167553024">Warrior Dash</a> outside of Orlando with a few friends. Muddy and cold, but a load of fun</li>
<li>Running around Lake Eola in downtown Orlando after work occasionally when not too hot out</li>
</ul>


<div class='pull-right '><p>The FitBit is awesome, but it doesn’t understand how much I hate wall balls.</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Got a FitBit for Christmas, with the hope of monitoring my sleep patterns and general fitness. When I keep track of things, they generally get better.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Work</h2>

<p>Worked at <a href="http://envylabs.com">Envy Labs</a> entirely on <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> all year long. My main focus has been on putting out awesome courses and trying to improve education through technology.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Work mantra: always ask “What Would Bret Victor Do?”</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Changed job titles to &ldquo;Technical Director at Code School&rdquo;, whatever that means.</li>
<li>Helped released a ton of Code School courses over the last year. A total of 17 went out in 2013</li>
<li>Helped write and worked on <a href="http://try.jquery.com">Try jQuery</a>, a free way to learn jQuery in the browser (and linked to from the jQuery site). Followed up by writing <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/jquery-the-return-flight">jQuery: The Return Flight</a></li>
<li>Helped write the Ruby/JavaScript side of Code Schools <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/core-ios-7">Core iOS 7</a> course, which lead to a few <a href="http://evaleverything.com/2013/10/04/teaching-ios-7-at-codeschool/">blog posts</a> about it</li>
<li>Wrote and helped implement <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs">Warming up with Emberjs</a>, a course to learn Ember.js from scratch. Basing the implemention on everything we&rsquo;d learned about teaching programming in the browser.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Great Meals</h2>

<p>I tend to remember amazing meals far longer than I probably should. Here&rsquo;s a few that stand out.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Having coffee at Victoria &amp; Alberts is a magical experience.</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Went to <a href="http://victoria-alberts.com/">Victoria &amp; Alberts</a> restaurant with Marilyn for our Anniversary</li>
<li>Had a great birthday dinner with Cask and Larder with Marilyn, my Dad and Paige</li>
<li>The Chefs Table of Edgewater for mothers day with Marilyns family</li>
<li>Went to Cask &amp; Larder for an Envy Labs lunch</li>
<li>The Chefs Table of Edgewater dinner with Alli and Jeff</li>
<li>Had Marilyns Birthday dinner at Pharmacy with tons of friends</li>
<li>Stone Crab Festival in St. Pete with Nate and so many friends</li>
<li>Food and Wine Festival with the Envy Labs gang</li>
</ul>


<h2>Personal</h2>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Seriously, the little girl in the Piano lesson after mine is soo much better than me.</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Bought an electric piano and started taking lessons every week. Still not very good, but making progress</li>
<li>Cleaned out and organized the garage and attic to where we actually know where things are</li>
<li>Launched a programming blog called <a href="http://evaleverything.com/">eval everything</a>, where I&rsquo;ve been writing about anything technical topics that are interesting</li>
<li>Updated this blog from it&rsquo;s previous setup!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>Looks like I&rsquo;m in the <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/">45% of people who make New Years resolutions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Continue learning piano</strong>. For me this means doing more practice at home as well as keeping up with lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Get into Angular.js development</strong>, which we&rsquo;re using for a new Code School project. Kind of have to do this one for work anyways, but I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do it too.</p>

<p><strong>Get more into JavaScript testing frameworks</strong> out there. I&rsquo;ve let my JavaScript go untested for far too long.</p>

<p><strong>Invite friends over more</strong>, typically to play games or anything really. Too many times this year we said &ldquo;we need to have a game night&rdquo;. If you ever want to have a game night, just let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Keep track of things more</strong>. Kind of an obvious one, but &ldquo;What gets measured gets improved&rdquo; has always been true for me. I&rsquo;m already doing these &mdash; some all the time, some intermittently.</p>

<ul>
<li>My Todo list in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></li>
<li>Workouts and fitness goals in Evernote</li>
<li>Piano practice in Evernote</li>
<li>Audiobooks in my <a href="/books">book log</a></li>
<li>Sleep in FitBit</li>
<li>Expenses in Google Docs</li>
<li>Weight via <a href="http://www.withings.com/en/scales">Withings</a></li>
<li>Monthly goals in Evernote</li>
</ul>


<p>Confident that 2014 will be an amazing year!</p>
