          <p>My yearly recap of what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last year. Looking back on this year, it was much less active than <a href="http://blog.adamfortuna.com/2011-year-in-review/">last year</a>. Most life changing events of the year would probably by Marilyn and my trip to Europe, having fun getting fit and trying to tackle more difficult problems at work (or at home).</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>

<p>Light year for quantity of travel, but the last one was big.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">Rails Conf</a> in Austin</li>
<li>Tampa various times</li>
<li>San Francisco for my sister Kara and Morgans wedding</li>
<li>Homosassa Springs for scalloping</li>
<li>London, Paris and Amsterdam with Marilyn for an amazing trip</li>
</ul>


<h3>Events and Entertainment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Saw a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/films/diary/by/rating/">load of movies</a>, my favorites for the year being: Cabin the Woods, The Hunger Games, The Dark Knight Rises</li>
<li>Lots of audiobooks including The Hunger Games saga, Game of Thrones Series, Enders Shadow saga and a few more</li>
<li>The TV Shows I looked forward to most this year were Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Homeland, Dexter and Breaking Bad</li>
<li>Pink Martini concert in Tampa</li>
<li>This American Life Live</li>
<li>Went on a hot air balloon ride with Marilyn</li>
<li>The Lion King at Bob Carr</li>
<li>Zelda: Symphony of the Goddess at Bob Carr</li>
<li>Beauty and the Beast at Bob Carr</li>
<li>Food and Wine Festival with the EnvyLabs gang</li>
<li>Reefer Madness at Theater Downtown</li>
<li>MythBusters Live at UCF</li>
<li>Weezer at House of Blues</li>
<li>Loius C.K. in Tampa</li>
<li>Front row of The Mikado at the English National Opera</li>
<li>Cabaret at the Savoy Opera House</li>
</ul>


<h3>Body</h3>

<p>Fitness was a fun priority this past year. It was less about pushing limits and more about finding ways to have fun that kept me coming back.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/">Worked out</a> at least 3x every week I was physically able to.</li>
<li>Got a Lasik adjustment in both my eyes, bringing them a little closer to 20/20</li>
<li>Strained my ankle rock climbing at Rails Conf in late April, took 3 months to heal to the point where I no longer felt pain</li>
<li>Ate mostly paleo (some surplus, some deficit) to help build a bit more muscle</li>
<li>Started doing yoga at work thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/aimee_simone">Aimee</a> organizing it</li>
<li>Dropped down to about 7% body fat during a month long paleo challenge at the gym before returning to a more stable weight</li>
<li>Started playing Ultimate Frisbee again, this time in the competitive league</li>
<li>Running more, including many runs around lake Eola with the EnvyLabs gang</li>
<li>Strained my back during a workout, causing me to barely be able to stand up or walk for 2 weeks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Awesome year working at <a href="http://envylabs.com">EnvyLabs</a> mostly on <a href="http://codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a></li>
<li>Had one very crazy week where I worked 85 hours (including 24 hours straight), went to 3 fancy dinners for <a href="http://forkful.net">Marilyn&rsquo;s blog</a> and still hit the gym 3 times</li>
<li>Involved in some way of releasing a number of educational courses for <a href="http://codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a> on a variety of topics including <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/journey-into-mobile">mobile web</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbonejs">backbone.js</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec">RSpec</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass">Sass</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r">R</a>, and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios">iOS</a></li>
<li>Rolled out a new framework for CodeSchool courses that allows more flexibility in how we implement them. Really looking forward to improving on this in the new year</li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<ul>
<li>This year I did a lot of throw away projects &mdash; projects I worked on for a week or two then completely abandon</li>
<li>Bought a Retina Macbook Pro, upgrading my 5 year old 17&#8221; MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Took an iOS Programming course at Valencia Community College to keep myself on track education wise</li>
<li>Moved off Bank Of America, and loving Simple so far</li>
<li>Had a break in where they stole our TV and Marilyns jewelry box while I was in Austin. Luckily Marilyn was gone at the time and Lily was OK</li>
<li>Lost our cat of 6+ years, Loverboy. He was always an outdoor cat, and lived to be at least 11 years old before disappearing. We can still hope that he was adopted</li>
<li>Made some improvements to the backyard including a low fence and lighting that makes being out back more fun</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>This coming year is the first that I won&rsquo;t have any kind of fitness/diet related goals. I&rsquo;m happy with where I am there, so just a matter of keeping the habits that have been built up. I&rsquo;m not a fan of making resolutions in general, but more listing out what my current objectives are and where I&rsquo;m trying to change my current behavior. At the moment this includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spend even less time watching TV and reading junk (reddit, hacker news)</li>
<li>Be more conscious of my time in general</li>
<li>Spend more time with friends and family</li>
<li>More time working on non-computer related projects (garden, house improvements, etc)</li>
</ul>


<p>We really have no plans whatsoever for the upcoming year right now, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to it!</p>

          <p>In college, and shortly thereafter, I wasn&rsquo;t the best with  money. I spent entirely too much needlessly upgrading my computer to the latest hardware for no real reason. Like many who come into some funds with a first job after college, I wasn&rsquo;t the most thoughtful about where I spent my money. It didn&rsquo;t take too long for that to change though.</p>

<h2>A Catalyst</h2>

<p>Three months after I graduated college, my mom unexpectedly passed away. The entire next year of my life was spent driving two hours each weekend to her now empty house and going through her lifes posessions and looking back on the home I  grew up in for 22 years. During this time I made the decision to save a great many posessions of hers that I couldn&rsquo;t push myself to part with. Still today I am sorting through this inheritance deciding what I want to keep for the rest of my life, and what is a memory I can save without the physical representation.</p>

<p>Since then one goal on my mind has been to go through and minimize the clutter in my life. This applies both to my thoughts on acquiring new stuff, and getting rid of anything unused. For instance, for every physical book brought home, I make sure at least 3 are removed. I try to follow a similar approach for everything I bring home &ndash; with the goal that whenever I bring something home for good, I donate or sell something to offset the addition.</p>

<h2>Collecting Experiences</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re not going to find many who disagree with the sentiment that experiences and relationships are the most important part of life. In my own experience it is easier to focus on this when your life is in order. In my case that meant fixing up and selling my moms old house, as well as simplifying my schedule to only those things that mattered most to me. I&rsquo;ve found the less clutter I have in my life, the more open I am to new experiences.</p>

<p>The end result of all this is that as you become more restrictive when it comes to acquiring posessions, you can become more open when it comes to new experiences.</p>

<h2>A Challenge</h2>

<p>How many things do you own that you could get rid of? Do you think you could elimate enough possessions to where you were down to 100 things? If so, you might want to attempt the <a href="http://guynameddave.com/about-the-100-thing-challenge/">100 Thing Challenge</a>. The idea is simple &mdash; elimate clutter from your life to the point where you only own 100 things (though some things you could own multiple copies of &mdash; like shirts or pants.</p>

<p>Do you think you can make it down to 100 things? Do you think it would make you happier?</p>

<li>Helped Marilyn on the technical side of her blog, <a href="http://forkful.net">Forkful</a> whenever possible. Her blog is doing great so far!</li>

<li>Got my feet wet with iOS development.</li>
<li>Started creating a budgeting application as a way of learning <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a></li>
</ul>


<p>As for goals for the new year? For most of this past year I was setting goals in smaller increments and working towards them, which I&rsquo;d like to do more of. It&rsquo;s great for developing a routine without too much overthinking.  Most things I want to do in the new year are already in progress &mdash; going to CrossFit more, working on (and using) the budgeting app, learning more iOS development, uncluttering the house and bringing in more color. Other than that, I&rsquo;d like to be more social in the new year, and spend less time watching TV.</p>

          <p>At the end of last year, I wrote a post about <a href="/2010-year-in-review/">what I&#8217;d been up to in the past year</a>. I do this every year (though usually unpublished) while things are still fresh in my mind, and find it fun to look back on the highlights and see what I was able to accomplish. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;d recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>Rather than writing this post at the end of year, why not try writing it a few months early? You might have a number of &#8220;new years resolutions&#8221; from eight months ago that need some reassessment, and now is the time! Go through everything you want to get done before the end of the year and write them down in a post as though you have already done them. Next, take the next steps to accomplish those tasks.</p>
<p>For me this called out a few things I really wanted to do this year that I haven&#8217;t made enough progress on. Cleaning out my garage, getting an iPhone app in the app store and any kind of exercise come to mind. Time to get crackin&#8217; on those!</p>

          <p>On Thursday, June 23, 2011 at about 11:30am, I had LASIK. It took years of coming to terms with the idea that if something failed I may end up blind for the rest of my life. Having come through the procedure successfully, and with practically no issues whatsoever so far, I wanted to give a basic heads up on what&rsquo;s involved in having LASIK, and what you should expect based on my experiences.</p>

<h2>Consultation (~ half hour)</h2>

<p>Choosing a place to have LASIK is the only decision you&rsquo;ll have to make. For me, I polled some friends to see where they had been and 2 here in Orlando suggested <a href="http://www.laservueorlando.com/">Dr. Magruder</a> &mdash; including one who had successfully had LASIK there the year before. An optometrist friend of mine suggested the same place, and for me that settled it.</p>

<p>Consultations are typically free, so this the time to shop around if you want to. Prior to talking with the doctor that will be doing the procedure, you will have eyes mapped out, your prescription checked and your tear generation measured. These measurements, coupled with a few basic questions, let them know if you&rsquo;re a good candidate for LASIK.</p>

<p>The only part that is uncomfortable is the tear generation test. Small tissue-like papers are put under your eyelids and kept there for a minute to measure your body&rsquo;s automatic response. Most people tend to have dryer eyes after LASIK, so if your eyes are already extremely dry according to this test, it&rsquo;s a warning sign.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a candidate for LASIK, you will probably talk to the doctor that will be performing the operation next. In my case Dr. Magruder was extremely personable and seemed to want to stay and keep prodding me for questions to make sure I&rsquo;d asked everything that was on my mind. This the typical part where he&rsquo;ll go over the format of what to expect.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in going forward at this point, you&rsquo;ll end up talking with someone who sets up the appointments. They&rsquo;ll go over the billing details, any discounts or financing available. In the case of the place I went, the procedure would be $5,000, which includes the pre-operation appointment, follow up appointments for a year and any adjustments necessary in the first year. They also offered a $500 discount if you schedule your operation within a month of your consultation (although the discount cannot be used if you use financing).</p>

<p>They listed out some dates they have available, and went over what the next steps would be if I did decide to have the procedure on one of those dates. I didn&rsquo;t feel pressured to make an appointment right then and there &mdash; instead they gave me all the information I&rsquo;d need to make it on my own, and call back to schedule it. I called back and made the appointment a few days later (after Marilyn had confirmed taking a day off to help me).</p>

<h3>Types of LASIK</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK">Wikipedia Article on LASIK</a> goes into much more detail, but the two forms flap creation (might want to read the wikipedia article if that term isn&rsquo;t familiar) are either by laser or blade. I went the laser route.</p>

<h3>Wearing Contacts?</h3>

<p>Depending on what type of contacts you wear, you will need to stop wearing them for some time before the actual procedure can be performed. This ranges from 14 days up to 2 months for harder lenses. If you don&rsquo;t wear contacts there is no waiting period required before proceeding</p>

<h2>Homework before the Pre-Operation</h2>

<p>After calling in and scheduling the procedure and the pre-operation, they called in two prescriptions for me to pickup at my local pharmacy along with an over the counter lid cleaner. 7 days before the procedure the lid cleaning began twice a day. The two prescriptions they gave me were:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.drugs.com/cdi/fml-forte.html">FML Forte</a></strong> &ndash; Used for treating inflammation (swelling, warmth, redness, pain) of the eyes and eyelids.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/ofloxacin-ophthalmic_solution/article.htm">Ofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution</a></strong> &ndash; Used to prevent infection</li>
</ul>


<p>Both of these eye drops were started 5 days before the surgery and taken 4 times per day.</p>

<h2>Pre-Operation Exam (2 hours)</h2>

<p>The pre-op is the most intensive eye exam you&rsquo;ve ever had. Think of this way &ndash; if after you have LASIK you discover you have XYZ wrong with your eye, it&rsquo;s difficult to prove if it was a result of the LASIK or not. Their protective response to this is a very long examination of every millimeter of your eye.</p>

<ul>
<li>Re-scan and mapping of your retina</li>
<li>Thorough eye sight test (the &ldquo;which is clearer, #1 or #2?&rdquo; test)</li>
<li>Numbing drops following by measuring your cornea (used for creating the flap later on)</li>
<li>Tests for blind spots in your vision</li>
<li>Eye dilation followed by thorough investigation with a head mounted magnifying glass</li>
</ul>


<p>In the last part, they were able to uncover that have I small holes in the back of my retina, which is why I occasionally have seen floaters in certain parts of my vision. I rarely ever saw these, but it was interesting to know <a href="http://www.bettermedicine.com/article/seeing-spots">the actual cause of them</a>.</p>

<p>After the op is over, you&rsquo;re given the usual sunglass shields (to protect your dilated eyes), and are now set for surgery.</p>

<h2>Operation Day (2 hours total, 5 minutes of action)</h2>

<p>You won&rsquo;t be able to drive home, so you&rsquo;ll need someone to accompany you the day of the procedure. After getting there, they&rsquo;ll go over things once more, and give you instructions on what to do in the time following the procedure. For me this included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t expose your eyes to bright sun.</li>
<li>Go home and sleep for 6 hours.</li>
<li>Take the 2 eye drops you have even more often (FML Forte every 2 hours, Ofloxacin every 4).</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you know what you&rsquo;re in for, they give you a Valium to calm you down. Having never had Valium, I didn&rsquo;t realize just how much this calms you down. After waiting 20 or so minutes, and with absolutely no fear at that point, they led me into the operating room. There are three stages to the procedure, each taking a very short time.</p>

<h3>Creating the flap</h3>

<p>In reading about LASIK, or watching The Discovery Channel, this always looked like the worst part of the procedure. They put a corneal suction ring in place around your eye to hold it in place while using a laser to cut a hole and in your eye and fold it back. While this sounds like a highly invasive part of the process, I actually had to ask the doctor &ldquo;Did you just create the flap?&rdquo;. There was no pain, and no discomfort &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t even know what hit me and the process took only a minute or two.</p>

<p>At the place I went, they had one chair for flap creation and another for the procedure. They led me over to the second chair, but I could still see alright even with the flap created. I imagine this is because I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntraLasik">IntraLASIK</a> rather than the steel blade method.</p>

<h3>The Procedure</h3>

<p>After laying down in the chair they lowered a large machine down over one eye at a time. They asked me to stare directly at the green light at the very center while the red lasers that took up most of my vision did the work. At this point my vision became so blurry that all I could make out with a red haze, but I tried to keep my focus on where I thought the green light used to be. The equipment is smart enough to track your eye to impressive accuracy (4,000 times per second), so it&rsquo;ll stabilize for minor movements. Do you know that smell when you&rsquo;re at the dentist having your teeth drilled? During this stage I was able to smell the same thing.</p>

<p>My perception of time might be off, but the entire procedure couldn&rsquo;t have taken longer than 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>Repositioning the Flap</h3>

<p>After everything is set, the doctor took what felt like a very damp paint brush and lightly brushed the flap closed. This only took a few seconds.</p>

<h2>Immediately After the Operation</h2>

<p>I kept my eyes closed for the drive home, but I wasn&rsquo;t feeling any pain at this point (thanks to the Valium). My eyes weren&rsquo;t itchy, but I took their advice and downed a Tylenol PM and went to sleep. The 6 hours immediately after are considered the worst, but it&rsquo;s easy to knock yourself out for that period. Your eyes heal best when they are closed, the more sleep you can get, the better off your eyes will be.</p>

<p>6 hours later I woke up and could see pretty darn well. Over the next few hours vision returned more and more to where I was seeing almost as well as with glasses. Things would occasionally go slightly blurry and my eyes would have trouble adapting &ndash; similar to the feel when you wake up in the morning before your eyes focus.</p>

<h2>First Follow-up</h2>

<p>The day after the procedure, they wanted to schedule a follow up to see how things were progressing. This is a really quick followup where they do an old fashion eye test (the big E test) and the doctor asks you a few questions. The day after the procedure my vision was 20/20 in my right eye and 20/25 in my left. According to the doctor it takes a few days for the swelling in your eyes to go down, and in that time your vision will improve. The best thing to do in the meantime is stay on top of your eye drops.</p>

<h2>Adjusting</h2>

<p>For me the hardest part of the entire experience came after the follow up. This is when your eyes are most sensitive to light and your body hasn&rsquo;t yet adjusted to the new vision you&rsquo;re now seeing. After 6 more days when I discontinued the anti-pain/inflammatory drops my eyes went through withdrawal for a night. They were both extremely itchy and all I wanted to do was rub them. By the next day the itching had subsided.</p>

<p>The night visor only needed to be worn for the 6 days after the procedure. This is just to prevent you from rubbing your eyes in your sleep or sleeping on them wrong.</p>

<p>The only side affect for me was that my eyes are now a little dryer than they used to be. Unless I was wearing contacts, I never needed to use eye drops. Lately I have been finding myself using them once or twice a day (at most). The oddest realization was that the feeling of having &ldquo;dry eyes&rdquo; seems to feel different than it did before. It&rsquo;s a tough change to explain, but it&rsquo;s not uncomfortable to the point where eye drops have ever been urgent, or even required.</p>

<p>By the Monday after the surgery I was back at work programming all day without any problems. Twenty days later my vision is up to 20/20 and things are going great! If you&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting LASIK, based on my experience it&rsquo;s a good time to do it. Good luck!</p>
