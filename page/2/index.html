          <p>In the Apple development world, there aren&rsquo;t many public conferences. This is unlike the Ruby community which has local events throughout the country, with lots of international ones thrown in the mix. Apple, on the other hand, limits their exposure to a single week in June known as WWDC, Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, held in San Francisco.</p>

<p>In past years, we&rsquo;ve seen the launch of devices by Steve Jobs like the iPhone and the iPad. Iconic moments like the reveal of the MacBook Air by pulling it out of a manilla envelope while popularizing the phrase &ldquo;One more thing&hellip;&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Keynote&rdquo; as this event is dubbed, is the only public event at WWDC, and kicks off an entire week of developer targetted talks. I was lucky enough to have <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> send me, <a href="https://twitter.com/eallam">Eric Allam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonfriskics">Jon Friskics</a> out west this year to experience this amazing event.</p>

<h2>Tickets</h2>

<p>Even getting tickets to WWDC is a bit of a miracle. With only 5,000 tickets and something in the neighborhood of 3,000,000 Apple Developers, there&rsquo;s a competition for tickets. In past years, Apple opened ticket sales at a random hour on a random day, and only at that time was the date for WWDC set. This year they did something different &ndash; they announced the date for the event a few days ahead of time, and gave the date and time tickets would go on sale.</p>

<p>Once tickets went on sale, the downside of this approach became obvious. Apple doesn&rsquo;t make it public how many people tried to get tickets, but they did publicize the fact that tickets sold out in 71 seconds. The 3 of us at Code School were refreshing the ticket sales page when 1:00pm came around.</p>

<p>We were able to add the ticket to our cart, enter our credit card information, and submit it. All of us got a 500 error, indicating that something went wrong on the server side. When we refreshed the page, we saw a message indicating that tickets were sold out.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the details, Eric wrote up <a href="http://initwithfunk.com/blog/2013/05/26/the-case-of-the-wwdc-sellout/">an analysis of this record sellout</a> .
Lucky for us, Apple gave us all a call individually 6 hours later, letting us know that a ticket was still reserved for us, and we still had a chance to buy it! 2 days later we had actual tickets!</p>

<p>If you know Portuegese, you can read more about this in an interview we gave: <a href="http://uoltecnologia.blogosfera.uol.com.br/2013/06/10/wwdc-2013-americanos-contam-perrengue-para-comprar-ingressos-do-evento-da-apple/">WWDC 2013: americanos contam perrengue para comprar ingressos do evento da Apple</a></p>

<h2>San Francisco</h2>

<p>I love San Francisco. In addition to having family and awesome friends in town, there is amazing food, interesting neighborhoods, and a wealth of variety.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mint Coffee at <a href="http://www.philzcoffee.com/">Philz Coffee</a></li>
<li>Interesting coffee from <a href="http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/">Blue Bottle Coffee</a></li>
<li>Vietnamese Coffee and Clove Orange Ice cream at <a href="http://www.humphryslocombe.com/www.humphryslocombe.com/Home.html">Humphry Slocombe</a></li>
<li>Squash blossoms, pork belly, meatballs and homemade soft serve at <a href="http://www.zerozerosf.com/,">Zero Zero</a></li>
<li>Amazing margaritas and Mexican at <a href="http://www.tropisueno.com/">Tropisueño</a></li>
<li>Indian Pizza from <a href="http://www.zantepizza.com/">Zantes</a></li>
<li>Sushi Burritos from <a href="http://www.sushirrito.com/">Sushiritto</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Having enough appetites are always a problem when in SF.</p>

<h2>Keynote</h2>

<p>Having never been to a WWDC, we heard a variety of things about the Keynote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be packed! If you want to get in, you shoule be in line by 6:00am.&rdquo;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an overflow room, and if you get there late, you&rsquo;ll have to watch it on screens there instead&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With this fresh in our minds, we joined the keynote line that wrapped around Moscone Center at 5:45am Monday morning. Not surprisingly for an Apple event, the line had already formed at 4:00pm previous day when we stopped by to get our conference badges. By 7am people were heading inside the building, and able to at least get some coffee and food. At 9am they started letting people into the (very large) room.</p>

<p>Unlike what the rumors said, there was plenty of space for everyone. We were sitting next to someone who got up at 9am and walked in at 9:30.</p>

<h3>Announcements</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not too enthusiastic about anything that was announced this year <em>in the keynote</em>. There&rsquo;s interesting stuff announced elsewhere, and not to say things are bad, just nothing was in the &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s amazing, I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; category. If I was pining for a Mac Pro I might have a different opinion, but I value mobility more than power.</p>

<p>The announcement that was most useful to me was the ability to have full screen applications on multiple monitors in OSX Mavericks, which I can say is actually pretty awesome. Other than that, here&rsquo;s my rapid fire opinion on the rest of it:</p>

<h4>OSX Mavericks</h4>

<p>Lots of small and useful changes for the most part. Been using it a week now myself, and like it. It&rsquo;s not going to change your entire world, but it&rsquo;ll make things a little easier and better. In addition to better battery life, the fact that apps that are using a lot of power show up in the battery pulldown is one of the biggest changes. If an application I wrote showed up in that menu, I&rsquo;d have a lot of incentive to fix it &mdash; or be shamed everytime someone saw it.</p>

<h4>iOS 7</h4>

<p>eh. It&rsquo;s a beta. We&rsquo;ll see what happens. Design wise though, I&rsquo;m hoping things change. I put the beta on my phone the Monday it was released, and despite a few surprises, it&rsquo;s been a stable release. The occasional app isn&rsquo;t compatible with it now, but that&rsquo;s to be expected. Control Center is very useful. The multitasking interface used to switch and close apps is a good improvement. The new tab view in safari is painful to use. iTunes Radio will guarentee I don&rsquo;t renew my Pandora subscription. Game controllers sound awesome, I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what people come up with for that. Some of the location awareness features are also intriguing.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>The new MacBook Air isn&rsquo;t much different. I understand why it&rsquo;s not retina &ndash; so it can continue to be their baseline notebook. It also guarentees I won&rsquo;t get one. The Mac Pro is not for me, but still an impressive machine. Curious to see what affect it has on the high end design world.</p>

<h4>Favorite Sessions</h4>

<p>One of the nice parts of the Apple Developer program (which costs $99/year), is that they record all of the talks given each year and make them available on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/">Developer Session Videos</a> page.</p>

<p>Apple makes it very clear that things discussed in these talks, and in every session outside of the keynote, is off limits for public discussion. Before every talk they announce this, and also mention that no pictures or recording is allowed &mdash; not to mention posters throughout the convention center mentioning this fact. In other words &ndash; if you want to see what&rsquo;s launching beyond what is mentioned in the keynote, you need to join the Apple Developer Program.</p>

<p>The session videos were available the very next day after they were presented. Considering they had about 25 videos posted each day, that&rsquo;s impressive. What happens at WWDC apparently has to stay at WWDC, but if you&rsquo;re a developer, you should watch the following videos:</p>

<ul>
<li>Platforms State of the Union</li>
<li>Exploring Scroll Views on iOS 7</li>
<li>Getting Started with UIKit Dynamics</li>
<li>Hidden Gems in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch</li>
<li>Designing Games with Sprite Kit</li>
<li>Advances in Objective-C</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to being able to download and watch these on your computer, Apple released an iPhone/iPad application that allows you to stream these talks straight to your device.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

<p>After going to primarily Ruby conferences for the past few years, this one had a very different feel. The biggest difference to me is the open vs closed source aspect. At Ruby conferences, most talks are about things people have built, or problems they have solved &mdash; perhaps mentioning some open source tools they used to accomplish their task. WWDC is more about letting the (registered developer) public see what Apple is providing.</p>

<p>Being able to hear about these coming features in person and be inspired by the energy of the event left me much more enthusiastic about developing than just watching the videos at home like last year.</p>

          <p>My yearly recap of what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last year. Looking back on this year, it was much less active than <a href="http://blog.adamfortuna.com/2011-year-in-review/">last year</a>. Most life changing events of the year would probably by Marilyn and my trip to Europe, having fun getting fit and trying to tackle more difficult problems at work (or at home).</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>

<li>London, Paris and Amsterdam with Marilyn for an amazing trip</li>
</ul>


<h3>Events and Entertainment</h3>

<ul>
<li>Saw a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/films/diary/by/rating/">load of movies</a>, my favorites for the year being: Cabin the Woods, The Hunger Games, The Dark Knight Rises</li>
<li>Lots of audiobooks including The Hunger Games saga, Game of Thrones Series, Enders Shadow saga and a few more</li>
<li>The TV Shows I looked forward to most this year were Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Homeland, Dexter and Breaking Bad</li>
<li>Pink Martini concert in Tampa</li>
<li>This American Life Live</li>
<li>Went on a hot air balloon ride with Marilyn</li>

<li>Loius C.K. in Tampa</li>
<li>Front row of The Mikado at the English National Opera</li>
<li>Cabaret at the Savoy Opera House</li>
</ul>


<h3>Body</h3>

<p>Fitness was a fun priority this past year. It was less about pushing limits and more about finding ways to have fun that kept me coming back.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/">Worked out</a> at least 3x every week I was physically able to.</li>
<li>Got a Lasik adjustment in both my eyes, bringing them a little closer to 20/20</li>
<li>Strained my ankle rock climbing at Rails Conf in late April, took 3 months to heal to the point where I no longer felt pain</li>
<li>Ate mostly paleo (some surplus, some deficit) to help build a bit more muscle</li>
<li>Started doing yoga at work thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/aimee_simone">Aimee</a> organizing it</li>
<li>Dropped down to about 7% body fat during a month long paleo challenge at the gym before returning to a more stable weight</li>
<li>Started playing Ultimate Frisbee again, this time in the competitive league</li>
<li>Running more, including many runs around lake Eola with the EnvyLabs gang</li>
<li>Strained my back during a workout, causing me to barely be able to stand up or walk for 2 weeks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Awesome year working at <a href="http://envylabs.com">EnvyLabs</a> mostly on <a href="http://codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a></li>
<li>Had one very crazy week where I worked 85 hours (including 24 hours straight), went to 3 fancy dinners for <a href="http://forkful.net">Marilyn&rsquo;s blog</a> and still hit the gym 3 times</li>
<li>Involved in some way of releasing a number of educational courses for <a href="http://codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a> on a variety of topics including <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/journey-into-mobile">mobile web</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbonejs">backbone.js</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec">RSpec</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass">Sass</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r">R</a>, and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios">iOS</a></li>
<li>Rolled out a new framework for CodeSchool courses that allows more flexibility in how we implement them. Really looking forward to improving on this in the new year</li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<ul>
<li>This year I did a lot of throw away projects &mdash; projects I worked on for a week or two then completely abandon</li>
<li>Bought a Retina Macbook Pro, upgrading my 5 year old 17&#8221; MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Took an iOS Programming course at Valencia Community College to keep myself on track education wise</li>
<li>Moved off Bank Of America, and loving Simple so far</li>
<li>Had a break in where they stole our TV and Marilyns jewelry box while I was in Austin. Luckily Marilyn was gone at the time and Lily was OK</li>
<li>Lost our cat of 6+ years, Loverboy. He was always an outdoor cat, and lived to be at least 11 years old before disappearing. We can still hope that he was adopted</li>
<li>Made some improvements to the backyard including a low fence and lighting that makes being out back more fun</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>This coming year is the first that I won&rsquo;t have any kind of fitness/diet related goals. I&rsquo;m happy with where I am there, so just a matter of keeping the habits that have been built up. I&rsquo;m not a fan of making resolutions in general, but more listing out what my current objectives are and where I&rsquo;m trying to change my current behavior. At the moment this includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spend even less time watching TV and reading junk (reddit, hacker news)</li>
<li>Be more conscious of my time in general</li>
<li>Spend more time with friends and family</li>
<li>More time working on non-computer related projects (garden, house improvements, etc)</li>
</ul>


<p>We really have no plans whatsoever for the upcoming year right now, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to it!</p>

          <p>In college, and shortly thereafter, I wasn&rsquo;t the best with  money. I spent entirely too much needlessly upgrading my computer to the latest hardware for no real reason. Like many who come into some funds with a first job after college, I wasn&rsquo;t the most thoughtful about where I spent my money. It didn&rsquo;t take too long for that to change though.</p>

<h2>A Catalyst</h2>

<p>Three months after I graduated college, my mom unexpectedly passed away. The entire next year of my life was spent driving two hours each weekend to her now empty house and going through her lifes posessions and looking back on the home I  grew up in for 22 years. During this time I made the decision to save a great many posessions of hers that I couldn&rsquo;t push myself to part with. Still today I am sorting through this inheritance deciding what I want to keep for the rest of my life, and what is a memory I can save without the physical representation.</p>

<p>Since then one goal on my mind has been to go through and minimize the clutter in my life. This applies both to my thoughts on acquiring new stuff, and getting rid of anything unused. For instance, for every physical book brought home, I make sure at least 3 are removed. I try to follow a similar approach for everything I bring home &ndash; with the goal that whenever I bring something home for good, I donate or sell something to offset the addition.</p>

<h2>Collecting Experiences</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re not going to find many who disagree with the sentiment that experiences and relationships are the most important part of life. In my own experience it is easier to focus on this when your life is in order. In my case that meant fixing up and selling my moms old house, as well as simplifying my schedule to only those things that mattered most to me. I&rsquo;ve found the less clutter I have in my life, the more open I am to new experiences.</p>

<p>The end result of all this is that as you become more restrictive when it comes to acquiring posessions, you can become more open when it comes to new experiences.</p>

<h2>A Challenge</h2>

<p>How many things do you own that you could get rid of? Do you think you could elimate enough possessions to where you were down to 100 things? If so, you might want to attempt the <a href="http://guynameddave.com/about-the-100-thing-challenge/">100 Thing Challenge</a>. The idea is simple &mdash; elimate clutter from your life to the point where you only own 100 things (though some things you could own multiple copies of &mdash; like shirts or pants.</p>

<p>Do you think you can make it down to 100 things? Do you think it would make you happier?</p>

<h2>Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>Decided to part ways with <a href="http://izea.com">IZEA</a> after 2 years, 10 months.</li>
<li>Took a month off of work, mostly to relax, clean out some of the house, and work on a side project.</li>
<li>Joined <a href="http://envylabs.com">EnvyLabs</a> in April, and continue to be amazed by both the people and the culture.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Programming and Technology</h2>

<ul>
<li>Launched <a href="http://lineofthought.com">Line of Thought</a>, a site for tracking what technologies different websites are using. More a &ldquo;for-fun&rdquo; personal project than a get rich project.</li>
<li>Helped Marilyn on the technical side of her blog, <a href="http://forkful.net">Forkful</a> whenever possible. Her blog is doing great so far!</li>
<li>Moved the code for my first ever website, DDRei to <a href="https://github.com/adamfortuna/ddrei.com">github</a> so I can continue to laugh at it for years to come.</li>
<li>Created my first ruby gem, a super basic wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/adamfortuna/ticketutils">TicketUtils</a>. Have to start somewhere.</li>
<li>Got my feet wet with iOS development.</li>
<li>Started creating a budgeting application as a way of learning <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a></li>
</ul>


<p>As for goals for the new year? For most of this past year I was setting goals in smaller increments and working towards them, which I&rsquo;d like to do more of. It&rsquo;s great for developing a routine without too much overthinking.  Most things I want to do in the new year are already in progress &mdash; going to CrossFit more, working on (and using) the budgeting app, learning more iOS development, uncluttering the house and bringing in more color. Other than that, I&rsquo;d like to be more social in the new year, and spend less time watching TV.</p>

          <p>At the end of last year, I wrote a post about <a href="/2010-year-in-review/">what I&#8217;d been up to in the past year</a>. I do this every year (though usually unpublished) while things are still fresh in my mind, and find it fun to look back on the highlights and see what I was able to accomplish. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;d recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>Rather than writing this post at the end of year, why not try writing it a few months early? You might have a number of &#8220;new years resolutions&#8221; from eight months ago that need some reassessment, and now is the time! Go through everything you want to get done before the end of the year and write them down in a post as though you have already done them. Next, take the next steps to accomplish those tasks.</p>
<p>For me this called out a few things I really wanted to do this year that I haven&#8217;t made enough progress on. Cleaning out my garage, getting an iPhone app in the app store and any kind of exercise come to mind. Time to get crackin&#8217; on those!</p>
