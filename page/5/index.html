          <p>About a year ago I was infatuated with Ruby on Rails, the Prototype Javascript library and just about any other cool css/js hot topics. I was reading everything I could get my hands on that was in the beginner to intermediate range. There was only one Rails book out at that time, Agile Development with Rails, and almost no Prototype support (well, there&#8217;s still not too much for Prototype unfortunately). The biggest help at that time were blogs like <a href="http://encytemedia.com/">Encytemedia</a> , <a href="http://particletree.com/">ParticleTree</a> , <a href="http://blog.nanorails.com/">nano <span class="caps">RAILS</span></a> and <a href="http://orderedlist.com/">Ordered List</a> . Up until around this time, I hadn&#8217;t started reading blogs outside of my friends list at Livejournal, but <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> changed that! So throughout all these great sites I noticed the trend of 9Rules affiliation, and although I didn&#8217;t dig into what it was at the time, it stuck with me. That was until one of these guys mentioned that 9Rules was allowing new submissions back in October. Now, throughout all the time when I was digging into the Rails community, I never saw much notice of Coldfusion. The 9 rules community, as well as a lot of the programming community just doesn&#8217;t see the many many Coldfusion bloggers that are out there. Doing a search on 9 Rules for Coldfusion, the only post that came up was one title <a href="http://www.brainfuel.tv/coldfusion">Is Coldfusion Dead?</a> (Note: I swear that&#8217;s what the title was; even it&#8217;s changed now, but I could be wrong). I chimed in of course, but one other comment stuck with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You guys are in your own little world of open-source/9rules love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it&#8217;s true! Not to put down anyone in the 9rules/open source/rails community, but as a note of just how far from the popular culture the Coldfusion blogosphere is. There are a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of coldfusion bloggers, just check out the <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com">Macromedia Weblogs List</a> . If i had to give a turning point of when I went from being a regular Coldfusion programmer, to a more advanced one I&#8217;d say the interest started right there. I started reading all the Coldfusion feeds I could find, started removing Rails feeds from Google Reader and yes, starting this blog. So with that said, I was happy to see my name on the <a href="http://9rules.com/blog/2006/12/new-additions-12-29-06-the-end/">last list of 9Rules entries</a> for the year! Hopefully I can bring a little more exposure to Coldfusion and Flex to the rest of the programming world without getting too deep into the Coldfusion world where things stop making since to outsiders. It&#8217;s also very humbling to be a very small group of programming blogs on 9Rules which I held in such high regard.</p>

          <p>Lately I&#8217;ve been negligent to my web projects in exchange for spending time reading. Unfortunately the distractions of blogs, digg, email and daily life have made this a slower process than I initially planned, but understanding how much time is spent on these things is the first step towards changing it. A while ago I moved my television out of the computer room, and I noticed an increase in my productivity. Similarly there&#8217;s a room in the house now that has no television or computer which can be an excellent reading room. It&#8217;s almost sad to think the time we spend as little kids watching TV repeating in this day with time spent repeatedly checking <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds, Digg, Slashdot and email. One of my new years resolutions (which I&#8217;m slowly phasing in) is to try to limit this unproductive online time. First step is to thin out my Google Reader down from it&#8217;s unmanageable 89 feeds (!). Not too many have daily postings, but <a href="http://lifehacker.com">LifeHacker</a> , <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCruch</a> , <a href="http://slashdot.org">SlashDot</a> and <a href="http://joel.reddit.com">Joel.Reddit.com</a> are definitely staying on. What&#8217;s on my reading list right now?</p>
<h3>Head First Design Patterns</h3>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/design_patterns.jpg" class="left" alt="" /> This is one of the best written programming books I have ever read, and has made me a true believer in O&#8217;Reily&#8217;s Head First series. The main feature of this series of books is that they put emphasis not on having a reference book, but on you learning the topics down cold. In the introduction there is a description of studies done on how people learn- &#8211; through multiple ways. This series uses this combination of ways to both drive topics into peoples minds and keep readers interested. I can&#8217;t remember a time when I was looking forward to reading a technical book (well yeah, maybe Pragmatic Programmer).</p>
<h3><span class="caps">UML</span> Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/UML-Distilled-Standard-Modeling-Language/dp/0321193687/sr=1-2/qid=1165736128/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/uml.jpg" class="right" alt="" /></a> Getting into <span class="caps">OOP</span>, <span class="caps">UML</span> seemed the logical choice to study up on next. Some of the diagrams in Head First Design Patterns would have been more clear to me with the _ shared language_ or <span class="caps">UML</span>.</p>
<h3>Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design: A Brain Friendly Guide to Ooa&amp;d</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Object-Oriented-Analysis-Design/dp/0596008678/sr=1-1/qid=1165736369/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/oo_design.jpg" class="left" alt="" /></a> Along the same lines as above, but another take on it. I probably would have read this first, but I&#8217;d already started <span class="caps">UML</span> Distilled before I knew of this one.</p>
<h3>Code Complete</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Second-Steve-McConnell/dp/0735619670/sr=1-1/qid=1165736860/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/code_complete.jpg" class="right" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Along with Pragmatic Programmer and Joel on Software, this is one that I hear being recommended for programmers by a variety of people. Really looking forward to this one.</p>
<h3>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420/sr=1-12/qid=1165737052/ref=sr_1_12/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/patterns_architecture.jpg" class="left" alt="" /></a> Sadly I started this book before getting distracted with Head First Patterns. I&#8217;ve enjoyed Martin Fowlers style of writing though, so this and <span class="caps">UML</span> design are both fun reads. If I&#8217;m still impressed when I finish them I might dive into MF&#8217;s Refactoring as well.</p>
<p>Some of these books directly apply to things I&#8217;m working on, but for the most part they are just general knowledge that&#8217;s beneficial. There are some more direct things to read though, like <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/">Fusion Authority</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-ColdFusion-Certified-Developer-Study/dp/0321330110/sr=1-4/qid=1165737455/ref=sr_1_4/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books">Coldfusion MX 7 Study Guide</a> ( I want to get CF certified after all :). I&#8217;d love to read up more on Spring and Aspect Oriented programming too somewhere along the lines. In the end though, books are all just support, it&#8217;s what we do with the knowledge from them that&#8217;s important, so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll work in some programming time along the way as well.</p>

          <p>Learning something new isn&#8217;t always easy, in fact it&#8217;s usually quite a challenge or you&#8217;d know it already. When it comes to programming, or anything with computers I can&#8217;t imagine learning by any means other than a hands on approach. You never see people become experts without doing, so attempting to learn something without at least an idea in place to apply what you&#8217;re learning doesn&#8217;t make too much sense. But how do you decide when to apply and when to keep on learning?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always struggled with to be honest. I&#8217;ll read the first chapter of a book and be so inspired by it that I have to start making something with the little bit of knowledge learned &#8211; only to find out that it&#8217;s either not enough to do anything I&#8217;d want in complete detail, or there&#8217;s just too much that was left unsaid to get a decent picture of the architecture. Recently when learning Ruby On Rails for example, I was reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Agile-Web-Development-Rails-Programmers/dp/097669400X/sr=8-1/qid=1160457267/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-8402271-3086451?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> and after each chapter I was amazed by amount of new possibilities that opened up at each step. I&#8217;d end up setting up rails, getting a hello world app going and spending more time researching online before even getting into the chapters that dealt with what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Thinking back, there was something wrong with how I was applying this newly learned knowledge, but what could be done differently? Working on a (so far un-nammed) project now with Model Glue: Unity, while at the same time learning it, Coldspring and Reactor has put me in a similar position. There is no book to read on these subjects though, and when it comes to MG: Unity there is very little sample code out there for fully developed websites (still looking actually). But instead of blindly pressing forward with the coding, I took a step back and listed out what the project I&#8217;m working on needed.</p>
<p>Instead of doing this on PC, I&#8217;ve started getting one of those black and white composition books for each site (i want to) work on. At the front is some basic information about the site &#8211; domain name if I have one for it, description, site goals, how it&#8217;ll be beneficial to it&#8217;s users, who the site will be targeted towards, revenue sources and simple task descriptions that I want users to be able to do. In the middle fold of the composition books I start designing the database, which is really one of the most fun parts for me. Each page has a date in the upper right corner, which is very helpful for keeping track.</p>
<p>One of the last things I do is make a list of pages the user can see &#8212; not taking into account into fancy ajax that might skew that number. This is a pretty boring page in some respects, as any user related site will start with registration, login, email confirmation, password reset, welcome page, etc. Finally, on the last page and working backwards I have layout drawings on one side of the page, and reviews about what was good/bad about that layout on the other side of it. All this is really to help get a handle on what needs to be done. At this point you could be building the application in any language and any framework, so long as it supports databases.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;re learning and applying this site to whatever it may be (or developing it in something you&#8217;re familiar with) you&#8217;ll basically go completely in reverse order. I start with the template, which is great motivation to work on the site when you see that much of it already alive. Working on the template is usually a great way to get a hande on a framework or a new language, because you&#8217;re not too far out of your comfort zone. At this point the layout should be completely html though, nothing fancy yet. Before continuing it&#8217;s really time to start with the heavy reading on the subject. You&#8217;ve wet your feet on how it works, the code is starting to look familiar, but there&#8217;s still a long ways to go.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve read up on the topic extensively, you can start dividing it up into pages, and gradually work on each of those after creating the database and your models. This article is aimed at learning a framework more than anything else. The process of learning a programming language from scratch is entirely different. This probably won&#8217;t work as well with javascript frameworks, which need some data to work with, or <span class="caps">ORM</span> which would have to be switched around too, but for something like Model-Glue, Fusebox or CF On Wheels this can be is a helpful process.</p>

<p>There is a delight in working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. &#8211; The Mythical Man-Month</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading quite a lot more lately, the above quote being one I just started tonight. Good break when you&#8217;ve hit a snag in a project and need to clear your head a little. Development on personal projects is going pretty well too. The most annoying part though is that I&#8217;m trying to do things the <em>right</em> way in a language I&#8217;ve never used before; which makes development agonizingly slow at times. Lots of time reading the documentation and googling for examples, let me tell you. But when it works it&#8217;s a great feeling. Database design is complete for phase 1, which will not include anywhere near all the features I have planned, but enough to build off. Not really putting a timeframe on the project as whole, just as long as I keep working on it I&#8217;m content. Eventually I&#8217;ll snap a picture of my sticky-note/whiteboard of the sitemap/structure; once I get a new camera. This thursday there&#8217;s a Ruby On Rails meeting at the <a href="http://www.orlandojug.org/">Orlando Java Users Group</a> all of us at work are going to check out too, so looking forward to that boosting my motivation a notch or two.</p>
