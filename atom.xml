    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are so many (good) podcasts out there it&rsquo;s easy to get swept away by them. About 2 years ago I was subscribing to over 30 of them, many of them news that overlapped with each other. Around this time, I decided to take a break from podcasts and binge listen to all 5 Game of Thrones books. For reference, that&rsquo;s over 200 hours of content.</p>

<p>After about 2 month of audiobooks, I switched back to podcasts and found I was able to unsubscribe from nearly everything and wonder why I listened to many of them in the first place. After that, what I listened to changed dramatically &mdash; focusing on storytelling, education and entertainment rather than news.</p>

<p>Stopping this deluge of information in podcast form was similar to when I stopped reading RSS feeds (thanks Google Reader for going away!). It was information I didn&rsquo;t know I didn&rsquo;t need.</p>

<h2>Habit Forming</h2>

<p>I have a tendency to take things to the extreme. Why do something if you&rsquo;re not going to go all the way? Marilyn knows that whenever we&rsquo;re watching a TV show, we&rsquo;re not going to just watch one episode, we&rsquo;re going to watch the entire series from episode 1, in order.</p>

<p>This same tendency that can cause a lot of wasted time when listening to podcasts, actually helps out for marathoning audiobooks. From when I wake up in the morning and roll out of bed, if I&rsquo;m not talking to someone, programming, reading or watching TV, I&rsquo;m probably listening to an audiobook. People around the office have no doubt seen me walking around with earbuds in. This resulted in 45 books in <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/?readAfter=2013-01-01&amp;readBefore=2014-01-01">2013</a> and 39 books (so far) in <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/?readAfter=2014-01-01&amp;readBefore=2015-01-01">2014</a>.</p>

<h3>Podcasts</h3>

<div class='pull-right '><p>We started a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/wOq3osBzGu/">Cereal and Serial</a> listening club at work for the Serial Podcast.</p>
</div>


<p>I have missed out on some amazing podcasts in that time, and there are a few I&rsquo;ll still make sure to listen to. Freakanomics, RadioLab and Serial (for example) are all amazing, as well as too many others. Rather than tuning in each week for most of these (ie, all but Serial), I&rsquo;ll let them pile up then binge listen to 3-6 months of backlog in a few days. For other podcasts, I&rsquo;ll only pickout the episodes I like where they&rsquo;re touching on topics of interest, rather than listening to every episode regardless.</p>

<p>Seems obvious enough to do this, but when you&rsquo;re the habit of watching every episode of a TV show, skipping an episode of a podcast seems like you&rsquo;re not getting the full picture.</p>

<h2>Positive Implications</h2>

<p>What did this change have on my life? It wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent, but a few things stand out. By tuning out tech gadget podcasts, I noticed my consumerist tendencies declined. By stopping some of the financial podcasts, I worried about investments less which resulted in less shifting money around and ultimately a more successful <a href="http://www.bogleheads.org/">Bogleheads</a> style strategy. By not tuning in on specific days each week for news, I had a less structured listening schedule where I wasn&rsquo;t immediately listening to whatever was available, and instead choosing what to listen to.</p>

<p>Listening around the house has helped me stay on track while getting things done. My entire garage was reorganized during a listen of <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/0380508567">Foundation</a>. <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/1583333894">Unstuff your Life</a> kickstarted a house cleanup that still proud of. <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/0812993012">Creativity Inc</a> began an amazing conversation at Code School that resulted in some effective changes to the way we work. <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/0307352145">Quiet: The Power of Introverts</a> was a interesting look at what gives me energy and helps drive me (and is a book I wish I had been able to read in middle school).</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>The drive for additional data on what I was reading led to the creation of an Ember.js Application for managing them, as well as a Code School course on what I learned building it. Lately, my obsession has been AngularJS, and I have learned a huge amount re-implementing it in the new framework. The next step is some crazy data visualizations using D3, which I&rsquo;m exited to have some data available to experiment with. If anyone wants to hack on it with me, the code is public on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/adamfortuna/scribe">adamfortuna/scribe</a>.</p>

<p>The inspiration for the books app was inspired by a few fellow programmers who have done the same. <a href="http://sivers.org/book">Derek Sivers</a> tracks what he&rsquo;s read, and tends to read business and personal improvement books. <a href="http://www.pamelafox.org/readinglist">Pamela Fox</a>, a fellow programmer in the education space, also tracks her books (we share a distaste for Neuromancer). Any other programmers out there do the same?</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in high school, I got kind of into anime. My friends and I were the ones hanging out in anime IRC channels, and trekking across the state to conferences to meet with others of our kind. Although my love for anime isn&rsquo;t what it once was, and I get winded playing 9 foot songs on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a>, that started a fascination with Japan that has stuck with me. It lead to me taking Japanese language classes in college, getting really into <a href="http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/list/favorite-kurosawa-movies/">Kurosawa</a> and <a href="http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/list/favorite-miyazaki-films/">Miyazaki</a> movies and wanting to someday travel there.</p>

<p><a id='last-gift'></a></p>

<h2>A Last Gift</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;d talked about traveling to japan with my mom during this time. Some of the places we&rsquo;d go and the sites we&rsquo;d see. When she passed away 2 months after I graduated college, I put a lot on hold. Rather than traveling or developing websites in my spare time, I was cleaning out and fixing up the house I grew up in. This meant driving from Orlando to St. Petersburg (90 minutes) on weekends for almost a year. It was without a doubt the most stressful time of my life so far.</p>

<p>On the weekend before my birthday, when the house was almost ready to sell, I was spending my weekend clearing out my moms room. In her closet, within a suitcase, I spotted a bank envelope. Written on it were the words &ldquo;Adam to Japan fund&rdquo;. I scratched my head and opened the envelope. Inside was $1,000 in cash, with a ledger on the side denoting deposits to it over the last year of her life. The thought behind this hit me hard, and I still tear up remembering it.</p>

<p>That was my moms last birthday gift to me.</p>

<p><a id='the-trip'></a></p>

<h2>The Trip</h2>

<p>Fast forward almost 8 years later. Marilyn and I have been together since before finding that special envelope, and had also put off this trip in favor of various other amazing trips. Towards the end of last year we decided this was the year and finally made it a reality.</p>

<p>The <em>tl;dr</em> of the trip is that it was amazing. We spent 4 nights in a hotel across from Nijo Castle in Kyoto, experienced mineral baths and amazing meals for 2 nights at a ryokan in Hakone and finished our trip by exploring Tokyo for 7 full days.</p>

<p>During our time in Kyoto, we took a food and sake tour with a local, who grew up in the midwest. We explored ancient shrines like Fushimi Inari and Kiyomizu-dera temple. Fed the sacred deer in Nara and explored the amazing temples of Japans first capital. We saw a Maiko (Geisha) performance in Gion, the historic home of the culture. We explored the ancient castles used by the Shogun. At only an hour away, making the side trip to Osaka resulted in some amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki">okonomiyaki</a> and culture shock.</p>

<p>In Hakone, we shed our shoes and enjoyed pampering and 12 course kiseki meals at a hundred year old ryokan. We took a ropeway tour of the mountainside and ate eggs boiled in Owakudani, a natural hot spring, before taking a ship across Lake Ashinoko.</p>

<p>With so much to do in Tokyo, there was no shortage of nightlife, food, shopping or culture to fill a week. We loved the feel of Hakajuku, littered with crepe stands, cafes, boutiques and second hand stores. Were were wowed by the sheer amount of people and lights in Shibuya. Walked through the blooming sakuras in Ueno park. Watched gamers and otaku wander the 6 floor arcades and model stores in Akihabara. Fullfilled a lifelong dream and visited the Ghibli museum. Woke up early and had sushi at the Tsukiji Fish Market. Had drinks at the Park Hyatt &mdash; famous for its role in Lost in Translation. Finished the trip with a very odd show &mdash; The Robot Dinner Show.</p>

<p><a id='what-to-expect'></a></p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p>We did a lot of research before our trip, and it paid off. Going to Japan without some preparation will mean missing out on a lot of opportunities to make your trip better. Here are a few of the things we encountered that either came as a shock to us, or that seriously help out if you know about them ahead of time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bathrooms don&rsquo;t usually have soap or towels. Most locals carry a small cloth to dry their hands.</p></li>
<li><p>Public trash cans don&rsquo;t exist in Japan. If you have trash, you&rsquo;ll probably need to carry it around until you get back to your hotel room.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many, many vending machines in Japan providing cold and hot drinks, instant ramen, beer, cigarettes and more. Next to each you&rsquo;ll see a recycling bin. This is because it&rsquo;s common for someone to buy and consume a drink right there. We didn&rsquo;t see people drinking on the go. Either you bring it home or you drink it there. (If you&rsquo;re a tourist it&rsquo;s OK to do this though, no one&rsquo;s going to be mad.)</p></li>
<li><p>People follow the law. Beer and cigarette vending machines don&rsquo;t require an ID to purchase, but yet there isn&rsquo;t an epidemic of kids buying them. The same machines in the US would either be policed or constantly empty. Same goes for simple things like waiting for the crosswalk to signal before crossing at 2am in a rural area.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a <a href="http://www.jrpass.com/">Japan Rail Pass</a> to travel between cities using the Shinkansen (bullet train). You can also use it on the Yamonote line in Tokyo. You&rsquo;ll need to reserve and have this delivered outside of Japan though. They give you a voucher, which you show at a JR office to get a full pass. There are JR passes in major airports, allowing you to grab it when you arrive. Make sure the station will be open when your flight gets in.</p></li>
<li><p>When it comes to trains, getting around between cities is easy using the JR Pass. You can show up at a station and make a seat reservation for the next available train. Since they leave every 30 minutes, you won&rsquo;t be waiting long. You can also walk onto an &ldquo;unreserved seat&rdquo; car without a reservation.</p></li>
<li><p>For travel within cities, you&rsquo;ll probably be using multiple companies subway lines. In Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo this applies. If you use the Google Maps, it&rsquo;ll route you through this, but you&rsquo;ll need to learn how to use the ticketing systems at each. All have an English option for the subway, but don&rsquo;t have one for buying bus passes. We stuck entirely to subway and taxis for our visit.</p></li>
<li><p>Assume no one will speak English. It was always a nice surprise when people could help us, but don&rsquo;t assume. It&rsquo;s worth learning a few phrases like &lsquo;sumimasen&rsquo; (excuse me) and &lsquo;Eigo ga wakarimasu ka?&rsquo; (Do you understand English?) will help immensely.</p></li>
<li><p>The level of service everywhere was amazing. Restaurants, taxis, trains, hotels and anyone we talked to in the streets were very nice and no one was rude. Even with the communications barrier, people gave you their time with a smile.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of articles on Japan mention you&rsquo;ll be taking off your shoes often. Don&rsquo;t listen to them. We took our shoes off a total of 3 times in 2 weeks (not including at the ryokan). Wear comfy shoes though. You&rsquo;ll probably be walking a lot more than usual.</p></li>
<li><p>Get a mobile cellular device with wifi. We rented a pocket wifi from <a href="http://www.globaladvancedcomm.com/">Pocket Wifi</a> for about $80 which served as wifi for both of us and provided unlimited bandwidth. They delivered it to the post office at Narita Airport (outside Tokyo) and we picked it up right after we arrived. There were also some vendors in the airport selling these. Make sure the post office is open when you arrive though.</p></li>
<li><p>You won&rsquo;t find any fancy breakfast places outside of ryokans. If you want breakfast, try a 7-11, a Dennys or a 24-hour noodle shop.</p></li>
<li><p>Some things you&rsquo;ll want to reserve before you leave. These include a Japan Rail Pass, a pocket wifi, Ghibli museum tickets and imperial palace tours.</p></li>
<li><p>You&rsquo;ll be going up more than you expect. Although most consumer shops and restaurants are at street level, on multiple occasions we had to take an elevator just to get to the entrance of a business. This was true for stores, restaurants and bars. These shops can be easily missed without exploring.</p></li>
<li><p>It rains a lot in Japan. Tokyo gets more rain than Orlando, Portland or Seattle (almost as much as Portland <em>plus</em> Seattle). You can buy umbrellas for $5 every few blocks in the city, and you&rsquo;ll see piles of cheap, broken umbrellas in the touristy areas after a storm. These aren&rsquo;t torrential downpours, but they are enough to drench you.</p></li>
<li><p>Almost every meal we had was between $30 and $70 total. Ramen meals came out on the $30 side for 2 people, while more fancy Japanese style meals with sake or beer were more like $70. Our entire food spend for 2 weeks was less than the cost of a night at Jiro.</p></li>
<li><p>Malls aren&rsquo;t like malls here. They&rsquo;re more like our department stores, with small, distinct stores very close to each other that all open/close at once.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Day 1: Travel from Orlando to Kyoto</h1>

<p>Kyoto was our first destination, but we arrived in Narita airport a few hours away. We grabbed a bullet train across the country and slept for a few hours as we made our way to our first stop of the trip. We would end up spending 5 days in Kyoto. Some of that time was spent exploring the city, but we also took day trips to Nara and Osaka to see the area. If you&rsquo;re only going to visit one location in Japan, I&rsquo;d suggest you go to Kyoto.</p>

<p>Our Delta flight left Orlando at 8:00am Saturday and after 19 hours of flight time we were in Kyoto, although the time of arrival was 4:00 pm Sunday. We picked up our pocket wifi, redeemed our Japan Rail Pass vouchers and caught the first available train to Kyoto. By the time we left the airport it was 7:00pm, and we wouldn&rsquo;t arrive in Kyoto until almost 11:00pm. After we made it there we grabbed a midnight snack by buying a meal ticket from a machine. Many cheap restaurants use ticketing systems for food. All the ones we tried had pictures of the food, but be sure you put in your money first otherwise you might wonder why its not working.</p>

<h2>Day 2: A Food and Sake Tour of Fushimi</h2>

<p>Scheduling a tour on our first day made us get up early and go out exploring sooner than we would have otherwise. We took a food and sake tour of Kyoto with Jason, a local of Fushimi, a town just south of Kyoto. Jason moved to the area after growing up in the Midwest and coming over for college in Tokyo. If you&rsquo;re looking for an amazing, personal, fun experience in Kyoto, I&rsquo;d recommend contacting <a href="http://jdkai.com/">JD Kai Tour</a> and seeing about scheduling one. At $50 a person per tour, this was one of the best values of our trip.</p>

<p><a id='food-tour'></a></p>

<h3>Fushimi Food Tour</h3>

<p>This tour took us outside of downtown Kyoto to areas tourists wouldn&rsquo;t normally go. We tried foods I&rsquo;d never seen available before in the US, but will seek out in the future. The softer tempura with a cod batter was delicious, as were the fresh sweet potato stuffed pancakes, squash croquettes, fresh sushi and eel stuffed omelets.</p>

<h3>Kyoto Sake Tour</h3>

<p>Following the food tour, we jumped immediately into the sake tour. The Fushimi area has long been a renown center for sake in Japan. It was close to the capital, and served by the springs in the area containing an optimal mineral balance for sake. On our walk over to this tour, we spotted our first cherry blossoms of the season.</p>

<p>Our first stop on the tour was a liquor store where we learned the basics behind the different types of sake. My knowledge of sake was limited to dry vs sweet and filtered vs unfiltered, but Jason went more into depth about the rice milling rate, pasteurized vs unpasteurized and more.</p>

<p>We went to the Gekkeikan Okura Sake Museum, home to a sake distillery founded in 1667. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend going to this museum without a guide, as the more interesting bits were in Japanese and would have been lost on us without a guide. Although, you&rsquo;d still get sake, so it&rsquo;s not all bad.</p>

<p><a id='fushimi-inari'></a></p>

<h3>Fushimi Inari-taisha &ndash; 伏見稲荷大社</h3>

<p>On our way back to the hotel, we decided to stop by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha">Fushimi Inari</a> &ndash; a large shrine that sits at the bottom of a mountain and trails up 4 kilometers into hillside. It was dusk when we made it there, so we only managed to make it about a kilometer up. Unlike parks in the US, this was open at all hours, with lanterns along the pathway. Fushimi Inari was founded as far back as 711, and is famous for having thousands of torii, the orange gates you see. It is one of the most iconic sites in all of Japan, and worth the visit.</p>

<h2>Day 3: Exploring Kyotos History</h2>

<p>Planning out a few days in Kyoto means deciding which famous sites you want to visit and which you can leave out. There is no shortage of shrines and castles within a short train ride. Today was our day to explore the town and see some of the sites.</p>

<p><a id='nashiki'></a></p>

<h3>Nishiki Market &ndash; 錦市場</h3>

<p>Within walking distance of our hotel was Nishiki Market, taking over a street and running about 8 blocks before coming in contact with another market running perpendicular to it providing more traditional shopping. The market thrives around 10am with vendors putting out their fresh tempura, fish, pickles and other wares. This market doesn&rsquo;t start as early as some others, so don&rsquo;t aim to get there right at opening, or you&rsquo;ll probably see a lot of closed stalls. We woke up early and grabbed breakfast before exploring the market.</p>

<h3>Kiyomizu-dera Temple &ndash; 清水寺</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiyomizu-dera">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> is another ancient temple and UNESCO world heritage site on the east side of Kyoto. It&rsquo;s name translates to &ldquo;Pure Water Template&rdquo;, which people line up to drink. Founded in 778, this temple sits high on the mountainside with a great view of the city. The tall main structure of the Buddhist temple was constructed using no nails.</p>

<p>We were there about a week before the cherry blossoms bloomed, but that didn&rsquo;t stop the view from being amazing. The trail up to the template was littered with stores selling trinkets, food and souvenirs, but we did manage to spot a shop selling nothing but Ghibli merchandise which we somehow left with money leftover.</p>

<h3>Gion &ndash; 祇園</h3>

<p>The small district of Gion is famous for it&rsquo;s Geishas and restaurants and sits on Kyotos east side. If you show up around sunset, you&rsquo;ll see a number of maiko fully dressed, heading to tea houses. We admired and appreciated the ones we saw, but didn&rsquo;t want to interrupt them with photo requests.</p>

<p>We wandered the streets, appreciating the small gardens and architecture that stood out in comparison to the rest of the city. One of the highlights of our adventures in Gion was a Maiko performance at <a href="http://www.kyoto-gioncorner.com/global/en.html">Gion Corner</a>. The short 1 hour performance showcases a number of arts including Kyo-mai Dance, Tea Ceremony, Koto Zither, Puppet Theater and Gagaku Court music.</p>

<h2>Day 4: Ancient Castles and Osaka</h2>

<p>Since it was raining, we wanted to keep it close to the hotel to start the day. Marilyn was still sick, so today we tried to take it easy to start the day. We stopped by a grocery store to grab a snack and was amazed by their fresh foods. You could pickup a full sashimi plate for under $6, or grab freshly made tempura by the pound.</p>

<h3>Nijo Castle &ndash; 二条城</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nij%C5%8D_Castle">Nijo Castle</a>, a UNESCO world heritage site and 400 year old castle was across from our hotel. We took a rainy morning and explored the castle and its grounds. Although pictures are prohibited within the buildings, the gardens and moat surrounding the castle were picturesque enough. At $5, the audio guide was well worth it.</p>

<p>Nijo castle was constructed with the help of feudal lords in the area who were all ordered to contribute to its construction. Some parts of it were also moved from elsewhere in the 1600s. It was initially built as the residence of the Tokugawa Shoguns during the Edo period.</p>

<h3>Kyoto Imperial Castle Gardens &ndash; 京都御所</h3>

<p>A few blocks from Nijo Castle sits the Imperial Palace. Stretching almost a kilometer, it offers a tranquil spot to get away from the streets of Kyoto. In order to get inside the palace, you&rsquo;ll need to make a reservation, but anyone can walk into the gardens. We arrived just as the plum blossoms were in full bloom. These bloom just before the cherry blossoms, but to me were the more beautiful in their colors and diversity.</p>

<h2>The Busy Streets of Osaka &ndash; 大阪</h2>

<p>After our castle tours, we made it back to the hotel to dry off before jumping on a train down to Osaka. It&rsquo;s only a 15 minute train ride by bullet train, which is free with a Japan Rail Pass. We headed to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namba">Namba</a> district, famous for its nightlife, restaurants and kilometer long shopping arcades.</p>

<p>We made our way down <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsaibashi">Shinsaibashi</a>, a hugely crowded shopping arcade with every brand you could imagine. We stopped by a 4 floor Sega arcade which had an odd selection of games. The entire top 2 floors contained room-sized photo booths, with costumes handy for the girls to change into (and only girls were allowed).</p>

<p>At the end of the street, we crossed the Dōtonboribashi Bridge and sat down for dinner at a okonomiyaki style restaurant. Imagine an egg heavy pancake cooked at a small grill at your table. It&rsquo;s also a local favorite that started in Osaka.</p>

<p>In our wandering, we also walked through the area featured in the documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493420/">The Great Happiness Space: Tale of an Osaka Love Thief</a>. It&rsquo;s an interesting documentary about the culture of host cafes &mdash; cafes where you pay exorbitant drink fees for the privilege of company and &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; from attractive men and women.</p>

<h2>Day 5: Nara, Japans First capital &ndash; 奈良市</h2>

<p>Just outside of Kyoto is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara,_Nara">Nara</a>, the capital of Japan about 700-1300 years ago. The area is famous for its deer and ancient temples in close proximity of each other which are collectively a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>

<p>We took the train down from Kyoto, which is actually about a 1 hour ride due to the number of stops.</p>

<p><a id='deer'></a></p>

<h3>Sacred Deer</h3>

<p>We you get off the train and make your way east, before too long you&rsquo;ll run into the famous deer of Nara. I like Wikipedias explantation of why there are so many.</p>

<blockquote><p>According to the legendary history of Kasuga Shrine, a mythological god Takemikazuchi arrived in Nara on a white deer to guard the newly built capital of Heijō-kyō. Since then the deer have been regarded as heavenly animals, protecting the city and the country.</p><footer><small>Wikipedia</small> <cite><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara,_Nara'>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>So it&rsquo;s basically like cows in India, except tourists come from far and wide to feed them. At night they are penned up and fed for their own safety and population control reasons. From what I&rsquo;ve read, they keep their antlers short to protect visitors.</p>

<p>You can pet them, but if you have food they&rsquo;ll head butt you for it. For only $1.50 you can pick up a pack of rice crackers to feed to them from any of the many vendors lined up on the main street. If you get some crackers here and keep them for the deer in Kasuga Tasiha, you&rsquo;ll be able to feed them one at a time rather than all at once.</p>

<p><a id='kasuga'></a></p>

<h3>Kasuga Taisha &ndash; 春日大社</h3>

<p>After pushing our way through the deer, we started the walk up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasuga-taisha">Kasuga Taisha</a>. I&rsquo;d heard from Marilyn it was a nice walk, but this was probably my favorite walk throughout the entire trip. If you know the scene at the beginning of Spirited Away where Chihiro is passing by many stone lanterns in a very close forest &mdash; this reminded me of that.</p>

<p>Leading up to the main shrine, you&rsquo;ll travel through the Kasugayama Primeval Forest. This ancient forest has a close, damp feel to it. The path is surrounded by thousands of stone lanterns all along the walkway, which you&rsquo;ll see deer peeking through.</p>

<p>Compared to the walk up, the shrine itself is anticlimactic, but worth the $5 admission while you&rsquo;re there.</p>

<h3>Lunch at the Garden</h3>

<p>Closer to Todai-ji Temple there are a number of restaurants and roadside food stands, but farther up towards Kasuga Taisha the options are limited. There is a small botanical garden you can pay a few hundred yen to tour, or if you only want a view you can stop in for lunch. We got off our feet for a while for a light lunch before heading to Todai-ji.</p>

<h3>Todai-ji Temple &ndash; 東大寺</h3>

<p>The most visited site in Nara is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Ddai-ji">Todai-ji temple</a>, a monstrously large Buddhist temple housing the worlds largest bronze Buddha statue. This was our last stop in Nara. When we rounded the corner and saw Todai-ji for the first time, we both gasped at the sheer size of it. Due to the surrounding gate houses, you don&rsquo;t get a close view of Todai-ji until you&rsquo;re close, and at that point it is the most impressive.</p>

<p>The walk up to Todai-ji is littered with stores and street food. I made it my quest to try each and every one.</p>

<h2>Day 6: Travel to Hakone &ndash; 箱根町</h2>

<p>Friday meant leaving Kyoto for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakone,_Kanagawa">Hakone</a>, a mountain town east of Mt. Fuji. Hakone is bit touristy, but it&rsquo;s a beautiful area and accessible by train.</p>

<p>From Kyoto, we took the Shinkansen from Kyoto to Odawara and picked up a &ldquo;Hakone Free Pass&rdquo; there. This pass was an amazing value, and made travel for the weekend extremely easy. At around $42 each, this provides train travel from Odawara to Hakone, mountain train travel farther up the mountain, bus access around Hakone, boat access on Lake Ashinoko and scenic ropeway access over Hakone mountain.</p>

<p>The trip from Odawara up to Hakone itself takes a while. The train to Hakone is quick, but soon after you&rsquo;re on a train especially designed for the mountain pass which slows things way down. There were some amazing views out the side, especially as it pulled off to the side to let other trains pass. After 5 hours of traveling, we made it to our ryokan.</p>

<p><a id='ryokan'></a></p>

<h3>Our First Ryokan Experience &ndash; 旅館</h3>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan_(Japanese_inn">Ryokan</a>) is a traditional Japanese inn, which originated on the foot highways that connected Kyoto and Tokyo. These paths have existed for hundreds of years, with ryokans dotting the road every few dozen miles (equal to a days travel). In more recent times the same concept has been adapted to more remote locations where people can get away from the city and be pampered.</p>

<p>How is a ryokan different from a hotel? For our case that starts when you pull up to the curb, where they checked our name against reservations and took our bags. After reaching the entrance we slipped off our shoes and changed in slippers, with them keeping our shoes safe during our stay.</p>

<p>Our room was similar to a western room with an additional extra room without any furniture. This room would serve as a dining room and optionally a sleeping area. One of the bathrooms also featured a hot mineral bath which we took advantage of multiple times. Rather than washing in this bath, however, you soap up and wash on the stool outside of it with a showerhead and bowl. After you are clean and have rinsed off all soap, you&rsquo;re ready to jump in the mineral bath.</p>

<p>Our room was so unexpectedly awesome, we ended up taking a few extra photos of it. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to stay in Hakone, I&rsquo;d recommend checking out the <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/mikawaya-ryokan.en-us.html">Mikawaya Ryokan</a>.</p>

<h3>Eating at a Ryokan</h3>

<p>Many ryokan, including ours, offer breakfast and dinner served in your room. This is coordinated with an attendant who greets you and acts as a point of contact with the hotel. Ryokan meals are experiences of their own. It&rsquo;s customary to take a bath before dinner and change into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukata">yukata</a>, provided by the ryokan.</p>

<p>We completely forgot about the bathing tradition for our first meal, which our attendant seemed to notice, but that didn&rsquo;t stop us from enjoying the amazing meal presented to us. The size and scope of the meal was more than we expected, but we ate every last bite.</p>

<p>Time to venture out into the Hakone area!</p>

<p><a id='day7-breakfast'></a></p>

<h3>Saturday Breakfast</h3>

<p>At 7:45am on Saturday morning, our attendant arrived and started setting up breakfast. Even though it might look similar to dinner, it was much more sweet and tofu heavy. For this meal we had 4 different types of tofu. Although I&rsquo;m generally a meat guy, the tofu dishes were memorable and delicious.</p>

<p><a id='owakudani'></a></p>

<h3>Owakudani &ndash; 大涌谷</h3>

<p>Reachable by ropeway, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cwakudani">Owakudani</a>, &ldquo;Great Boiling Valley&rdquo;, is a small volcanic valley bursting with steam vents and boiling water. It&rsquo;s also a stop on the ropeway, on the way to Lake Ashinoko, and worth exploring.</p>

<p>After you exit the ropeway, you&rsquo;ll be hit by some tremendous, cold winds. These nearly blew us over and we weren&rsquo;t prepared for the temperature. We continued on to the vents themselves, following the crowd. The eggs cooked in the sulfurous water turn black, but taste the same as any hard boiled eggs. They claim that each egg you eat adds 7 years to your life. At $5 for 35 years, that&rsquo;s quite a deal.</p>

<p>We explored the area and the small shops dotting the path. If you&rsquo;re in the mood for an &ldquo;American Dog&rdquo; (corn dog), this is the place. Otherwise you can grab a Hakone beer, or some local cider for later.</p>

<p><a id='ashinoko'></a></p>

<h3>Lake Ashinoko &ndash; 芦ノ湖</h3>

<p>The ropeway lets out right at Lake Ashinoko, where we jumped right on one of the two ships that traverses the lake. This picturesque but extremely crowded boat took us from the mostly uninhabited north side of the lake to the much more lively south side.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us, it was a cloudy day when we were there. On a good day, you can see Mt. Fuji during this trip, but we were treated with fog and chilly mountain air instead. Despite that, the lake air was refreshing, and we were at the other side before we knew it.</p>

<p>The guide we read mentioning stopping for a quick lunch of lake smelt close by, which a number of restaurants along the lakeside serve. We found a small casual restaurant overlooking the lake and stopped in for a bite. The smelt had a similar taste to fresh fish sticks, but were tasty.</p>

<p><a id='hakone-shrine'></a></p>

<h3>Hakone Jinja</h3>

<p>On the south end of Lake Ashinoko lies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakone_Shrine">Hakone Jinja</a>, a small Shinto shrine with a welcoming gate you can see from the water. We made the short walk over the ship through the tall Cyprus trees to the main entrance. The Shrine is small, but was worth the visit for the path alone.</p>

<p>We learned that the Hakone shrine is also a place for women to go to ask for a boyfriend. This might explain the groups of women we spotted in the Hakone area.</p>

<h3>Saturday Dinner</h3>

<p>After a day of traveling around Hakone, we returned to our room with enough time to get in a relaxing mineral bath in our room before dinner. This meal included blowfish, something I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to try, but was on my bucket list while in Japan. As exotic as it was, I wouldn&rsquo;t order it again. It tasted like fish, but beyond that the intricacies were lost on me.</p>

<h3>To Tokyo! &ndash; 東京</h3>

<p>We checked out and our trek to Tokyo began! From Hakone, we grabbed a bus from in front of our hotel all the way down to Odawara station. The bus route is less scenic than the rail route, but its also a straight shot that takes you from the hotel straight to the Shinkansen station. The trip takes just as long, but you don&rsquo;t have to transfer from bus to train to other train.</p>

<p>We made it to Tokyo and opted to take a cab from the station to the hotel. As much as I love the subway/rail system in Japan, when we can spend an extra $2 and get a cab (and have bags!) why not? We checked into our hotel early &mdash; around 1pm and liked what we saw. Our hotel was in the Meguro district, a mostly residential area south of Shibuya with a number of universities in the area. It turned out to be a good jumping off point for our Tokyo explorations.</p>

<p><a id='#exploring-shibuya'></a></p>

<h3>Exploring Shibuya to Harajuku &ndash; 渋谷区</h3>

<p>After getting off our feet for a while, we jumped on the hotel shuttle to the Meguro JR Rail station and headed north to Shibuya. If you have a JR pass, you can use that on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamanote_Line">Yamanote Line</a>, a popular rail route that runs in a loop around Tokyo. It hits many of the major sites including Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku, Ueno Park and Akihabara.</p>

<p>We exited the station and, for some reason, decided to head south. Turns out everything is north of the station. Despite that we did see a beautiful street before turning around.</p>

<p>We wandered north and walked through the busy Shibya crossing intersection. Past that we walked through one of the 7 story malls in the area before realizing the target was a much younger audience. We stumbled into a hole in the wall ramen shop for some more Hokkaido style ramen and beer. After eating, we went back to the Starbucks at the crossing in order to get a good viewing spot. To our surprise, we spotted Julius from <a href="http://droolius.com/">Droolius</a> two spots in front of us in line! Running into someone we knew from Orlando in the busiest intersection in the world was pretty amazing.</p>

<p>After touching base and making some plans, we grabbed a green tea and a cherry blossom donut from Krispy Kreme and headed north to Harajuku. The shopping side of that district was closing as we were getting there, limiting our options for the night.</p>

<p><a id='day9'></a></p>

<h2>Day 9: Harajuku &amp; Shinjuku</h2>

<p>We started the day right where we left off &mdash; 3 Yamanote line stops up from our hotel in Harajuku. The area is a lot more lively during the day since it is mostly for shopping and closes down by 8pm.</p>

<p><a id='harajuku'></a></p>

<h3>The Feel Harajuku &ndash; 原宿</h3>

<p>On the walk over we passed by all the typical high end clothing stores you would imagine. Each with their own intricately designed buildings to draw attention. Walking the main streets you might think this is all there is the Harajuku.</p>

<p>We were on a mission to meet up Koichi, one of Marilyn&rsquo;s coworkers from <a href="http://booking.com">Booking.com</a>. We found their location above an Armani Cafe (Armani has cafes?) and got a quick tour of their office. Not a bad location, and on a clear day you could see Mt. Fuji.</p>

<p>We grabbed lunch &mdash; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkatsu">Tonkatsu</a> place close by. Throughout the trip we confused Tonkatsu (breaded, fried pork cutlet) and Tonkotsu (a cloudy, ramen broth). The Tonkatsu was served with a bed of cabbage, which seemed like an odd pairing. The spicy mustard that came with it, along with barbecue sause and curry made for a warm and hearty lunch.</p>

<p>When we pressed the group for things to do in Harajuku a few suggestions came out: try a crêpe, see Yogogi Park and visit the Meiji Shrine. All were within walking distance, so we set out for them next.</p>

<p><a id='yoyogi'></a></p>

<h3>Yoyogi Park &amp; Meiji Shrine &ndash; 代々木公園</h3>

<p>Yoyogi Park is a huge park that skirts the Harajuku district all the way up to Shinjuku. When you enter it off the main area, there are very large set paths to walk, and no cars allowed. The park is known for it&rsquo;s interesting fashion scene which hangs out on the bridge from Harajuku on sundays.</p>

<p>We walked up some side streets to the park and shrine itself, entering through the north entrance. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Shrine">Meiji Shrine</a> resides on that side of the park, and was built in the 1920s &mdash; a full millennium after some of the other shrines we visited.</p>

<p>The shrine itself was less visually amazing than others like <a href="#fushimi-inari">Fushimi Inari</a> or <a href="#kasuga">Kasuga Taisha</a>, but stands in stark contrast to the surrounding city. The shrine itself was much more open than others we&rsquo;d visited, and could no doubt support the large population of Tokyo that visits.</p>

<h4>Park Hyatt Hotel</h4>

<p>We realized we were within walking distance of the <a href="http://tokyo.park.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html">Park Hyatt Tokyo</a>, the hotel made famous in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost In Translation</a>. Having seen that movie more times than I can count, this was a good chance to see the amazing view in person.</p>

<p>Finding it was a little odd. The lobby for it is actually on the 37th floor of the Shinjuku Park Tower building, and takes up the top 14 floors. The top floor is the New York Bar &amp; Grill &mdash; the hotel bar used in the movie. After 8pm this bar charges a $20 cover. We stopped by before sunset and were able to enjoy a cocktail before then. I ordered a cocktail with a sake base, optimistic they might do something interesting with it. Unfortunately what came out was a tiny, weak pink drink which I could have finished in a single sip. Marilyn&rsquo;s was much better, but the $18 drinks prices are justified by the view more than the taste.</p>

<p><a id='izakaya'></a></p>

<h3>An Izakaya Visit &ndash; 居酒屋</h3>

<p>After stopping by the hotel to change, we headed out for dinner in Shinjuku with Koichi. We were initially thinking about trying a shabu-shabu place, but ended up a izakaya. Izakaya are the equivalent of pubs in the US, but if they had sushi that was on par with a sushi restaurant on the beach.</p>

<p>Drinks here, and at every place we visited were extremely limited. Most places only carry one type of beer &ndash; usually Sapporo, Kirin or Asashi. The place we visited was a Sapporo place, but also had some sake and sake cocktails with fresh grapefruit.</p>

<p>Expecting pub fare, we were amazed at the quality and freshness of what we tried. This included a fresh sashimi plate, gyoza, lightly cooked mini octopus, pork skewers, tofu and a tuna bowl. This plus all the beer we could drink was under $30 each. The cost of just the sashimi in the US would&rsquo;ve been more than that.</p>

<p><a id='day10'></a></p>

<h2>Day 10: Ueno Park &amp; Akihabara</h2>

<p>We missed the cherry blossom bloom in Kyoto, but were lucky enough to catch them in Tokyo where is happens slightly earlier. We seized the chance to visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ueno_Park">Ueno Park</a>, a large public park in Tokyo.</p>

<p><a id='ueno'></a></p>

<h3>Ueno Park &ndash; 上野公園</h3>

<p>On the opposite side of Tokyo as we were staying (as far as the Yamanote line goes) is Ueno Park. It&rsquo;s not as dense with trees and shade as Yoyogi park, but is famous for its hundres of cherry blossoms that line the paths.</p>

<p>We took the train down, expecting a crowd, but the actual crowd was incredible! It was shoulder to shoulder throughout the park. With rain expected for the rest of the week, and the cherry blossom season already short, everyone was taking advantage of the clear day. The amount of blossoms was amazing at this park &mdash; turning the entire field of view white with blooms.</p>

<p>There were street vendors with all variety of food next to business men and women taking their lunch breaks. We tried a number of treats including a pork skewer, a chocolate covered banana, some fried chicken and some beer to wash it down. This was more comfort food than exploration, but hit the spot.</p>

<p><a id='akihabara'></a></p>

<h3>Akihabara &ndash; 秋葉原</h3>

<p>One train stop down from Ueno Park is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihabara">Akihabara</a>, the center of otaku culture in Japan. The area is famous for its multiple large arcades (some 6 floors), video and anime stores as well as electronics galore.</p>

<p>Without a goal in mind, we started browsing stores that looked interesting. On a given street we&rsquo;d see stores at street level, as well as a stairs up to others hidden away. We wandered through an arcade watching people play games I&rsquo;d never seen before. Looked through a few game and figurine stores at characters both muscular and skimpy and eventually headed out.</p>

<p>Akihabara was one of the few let downs of the trip. I imagine 15-years-ago-me would&rsquo;ve enjoyed it more, but today-me was more concerned about the maid cafe hostesses being harassed in the streets. Oh yeah, there are a lot of maid cafes there.</p>

<h3>Cocktails at Bar Ishinohana</h3>

<p>Not wanting to leave Tokyo without trying some classic cocktails, we stopped by <a href="http://ishinohana.com/en/">Ishino Hana Bar</a>, a small classic cocktail bar in south Shibuya. We&rsquo;d end up stopping by again the next night with some friends, eventually trying out 7 cocktails between the two of us. Our of those about 3 were amazing &mdash; including the Kurosawa, a whiskey cocktail I reordered the next night.</p>

<p>We also stopped by <a href="http://goodbeerfaucets.jp/">Goodbeer Faucets</a> in the same part of town. This small pub catered more to the English crowd, but had the largest selection of Japanese beers of any place we came across on our trip.</p>

<h2>Day 11: Ghibli Museum &ndash; 三鷹の森ジブリ美術館</h2>

<p>When we decided to go to Japan, the first thought wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;when?&rdquo;, &ldquo;how much?&rdquo; or &ldquo;where?&rdquo; but &ldquo;We have to go to the Ghibli Museum!&rdquo;. Even if the Akihabara district was a let down, the Ghibli museum ended up going beyond our expectations.</p>

<p>As much I&rsquo;d love to write about the experience, one of the highlights of the experience is the feeling of childlike exploration you get going through the disorganized museum. If you do want to go, I recommend doing as little research as possible. We made our way through the entire place twice, gawking at the smallest details.</p>

<p>If you do want to go to the museum, you&rsquo;ll need to make reservations ahead of time &mdash; up to 3 months. When you show up, you&rsquo;ll exchange your voucher for a real ticket, granting you access. The ticket itself is a cell from a Ghibli movie &mdash; mine was Ponyo eating ramen!</p>

<p>To keep the experience personal, no pictures are allowed inside. The only pictures spots are the roof, where a giant Robot Soldier stands, and the outside cafe. The cafe had one of the best beers we&rsquo;d tried, as well as some delicious ice cream.</p>

<p>In terms of souvenirs, there aren&rsquo;t many places that I&rsquo;ll fork over cash at. The gift shop to the museum features many unique items only available there. I ended up with two shirts, some cookies, a CD, a canvas bag, some movie cells, a museum guidebook, map and even more.</p>

<h3>Tonkotsu Ramen</h3>

<p>Afterwards we stopped by a Tonkotsu Ramen shop in Harajuku for the fattiest ramen we tried during our stay there. This place was right at the Harajuku Yamanote intersection and amazing. I felt drunk on pork fat after I left.</p>

<h3>A Traditional Japanese Dinner</h3>

<p>Following our amazing Ghibli museum visit, we stopped Bar Ishinohana for another drink before heading to Shibuya for a traditional Japanese dinner with friends. This was the first restaurant we visited where we needed to take off our shoes as well.</p>

<p>You know those restaurants where you need to sit Japanese style on the floor rather than in chairs? This was one of those. To our surprise, most places that offer this style of seating have a pit under the table for your legs should you want to sit with them down. Secrets were reveled that night!</p>

<p>The food and drinks were also amazing, albeit in small portions. They did have a wide sake menu there and offered a tasting of 3 different sakes at a reasonable price. We decided to just order 4 tasting all with different sakes and try them all. If you can try 12 different sakes in one night, do it.</p>

<h2>Day 12: Ginza, Kabuki, Iron Chef &ndash; 銀座</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;d heard good things about the Ginza district, and knew we wanted to at least walk around the area some. We decided to take it a little easy on this day to recover from our late-night sake fest, and attempted to stay out of the rain.</p>

<p>We headed to <a href="http://nihonbashi-yukari.com/">Nihonbashi Yukari</a> for an early lunch, a restaurant on the north side of the Ginza district, by a chef what won multiple times as a challenger on Iron Chef including the 2002 tournament. The restaurant has opted out of the Michelin program, although many think it would well be deserving of a star or two. We scheduled our reservation through the very helpful concierge at our hotel and when we walked through the door, wondering if I was in the correct place, all I heard was &ldquo;Adam-san!?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The meal was delicious &ndash; and one of the more memorable meals outside of our ryokan. An egg custard appetizer, followed by a sashimi and tempura (or pork belly) main plate, accompanied by soup and followed by a house made ice cream. Not a bad lunch at $30.00.</p>

<p><a id='ginza'></a></p>

<h3>The Luxurious Ginza District</h3>

<p>If you could make the Mall at Millenia (Orlando Mall famous for its high end brands) into a district, you&rsquo;d get Ginza. Walking down the street you see all the big name stores you&rsquo;d image Apple plus every purse/bag/watch manufacturer. Aside from walking through the Apple store and browsing a floor of a mall in the area, we weren&rsquo;t too interested in the area. The rain might&rsquo;ve dampened our spirits, but at least it drove us to the south end of Ginza for our next stop &mdash; a kabuki show.</p>

<p><a id='kabuki'></a></p>

<h3>A Traditional Kabuki Show &ndash; 歌舞伎</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a number of live performances, but the format of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki">Kabuki</a> was new to me. First off, what is Kabuki? It&rsquo;s classical Japanese drama, performed entirely by men. An entire Kabuki show typically includes 3 acts and takes upwards of 3 hours (including breaks). If you&rsquo;re only interested in a single act, you can acquire a single act ticket, which allows you an unspecified seat at a specific show. Full tickets to a show might start at $40, while single act tickets are closer to $12 a person.</p>

<p>When you get a single act ticket, you&rsquo;ll receive a ticket number. Just before the showing, you&rsquo;ll line up by your ticket number (think Southwest Air) then be let into a small balcony in the theater for people to grab the best seats they can.</p>

<p>The show we ended up seeing focused around political intrigue and would be too difficult to explain without a few paragraphs. What hit me most about it was the very slow pace of the storytelling. At 90 minutes it was a long show for containing only 3 separate scenes. The story and acting kept us interested, but by the end I was straining to stay focused.</p>

<p>For $5 you can buy an audio commentary which was well worth it. It isn&rsquo;t a translation of what is being said, but more a way to follow along the high level points and explain the motivations of the individual characters.</p>

<h2>Day 13: Tsukiji Fish Market, Robot Restaurant</h2>

<p>The Tsukiji Fish Market is most famous for its tuna auction, held every morning around 6am. Beyond that though is a thriving fish and goods market that stretches about 5 blocks by 3 blocks.</p>

<p><a id='tsukiji'></a></p>

<h3>Tsukiji Fish Market &ndash; 築地</h3>

<p>We weren&rsquo;t planning on heading to the tuna auction, so we woke up late (7:30) and headed over to the market for some breakfast sushi. The most popular sushi places have a 2-3+ hour wait, so we headed to one on the same block that was more in the 15 minute range. We had a delicious omakase breakfast including sea urchin, fatty tuna and enough others to (mostly) fill us up.</p>

<p>Afterwards we wandered around the market checking out the various goods there. We had hoped to see the wholesale market too &mdash; the one famous for its fresh fish, but we only skirted the edges of it rather than be run over by the dozens of carts. Outside in the public market, one place was cooking scallops and serving them there, which were delicious. Another was shucking some of the hugest oysters I&rsquo;ve ever tried and serving them raw. We&rsquo;re talking 3 bite oysters here.</p>

<p>Other than that there were restaurants for most Japanese cuisine. Unlike Ueno Park, there wasn&rsquo;t street food but instead small counter restaurants. After seeing a number of markets in Kyoto, this wasn&rsquo;t as amazing at it probably would&rsquo;ve been had it been the first. There was more focus on seafood, of course, but one can only eat so much.</p>

<h3>Robot Restaurant</h3>

<p>When it comes to the crazy side of Japan, we knew we wanted to do something. We&rsquo;d seen shrines and a lot of natural beauty, but nothing on the cheesy side &mdash; and that&rsquo;s what Robot Restaurant is.</p>

<p>Nestled in a district filled with love hotels, Robot Restaurant is what Americans think Japanese entertainment should be. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teppanyaki">Teppanyaki</a>, the Japanese style of food where a chef grills your food right in front of you, was started in the 1940s to introduce foreigners to Japanese style food in a non-intimidating manner. We felt this show had a similar goal of catering to foreigners.</p>

<p>The show itself was&hellip; interesting. The amount of lights, loud sounds and scantily clad women was more than I could have imagined. What kind of show was it? It started with 12 women taiko drumming, followed by my favorite song from Nausicaa being sung, followed by robot battles and dancing thown in.</p>

<p>If you go, I recommend drinking heavily &mdash; you&rsquo;ll enjoy it more that way.</p>

<h2>Day 14: Back to Orlando!</h2>

<p>Even though we were set to leave on this day (Saturday), our flight wouldn&rsquo;t leave until midnight, leaving the entire day open for exploration. We decided to take it easy, staying somewhat close to the hotel where our bags were stashed.</p>

<p><a id='ippudo'></a></p>

<h3>Ippudo Ramen &ndash; 博多一風堂</h3>

<p>One place I absolutely wanted to go to while in Japan was to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippudo">Ippudo Ramen</a>, a Japanese ramen chain that has spread to New York, China and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Famous for its Hokkaido style ramen, our meal was delicious and fresh. Coming in on a Saturday morning in the Ebisu district, we were surrounded by families out for a well priced lunch sitting alongside businessmen stopping in for lunch at the counter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to say I have a good idea of which ramen we had was the best on our trip, but in all honestly they were all delicious. The Tonkotsu was surely the most fatty and difficult to digest, but all were satisfying.</p>

<ul class='gallery row clearfix'><li class='col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 lazy'><a href='http://s.adamfortuna.com/images/galleries/japan_day14/ramen.jpg' class='fancybox' data-fancybox-group='japan_day14' title='Delicious ramen.'><img src='http://adamfortuna.com/images/placeholder.gif' data-src='http://s.adamfortuna.com/images/galleries/japan_day14/resized/ramen.jpg' /></a></li></ul>

<h3>The Flight</h3>

<p>At midnight we took off back for Orlando, saying goodbye to Tokyo and Japan.</p>

<ul class='gallery row clearfix'><li class='col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 lazy'><a href='http://s.adamfortuna.com/images/galleries/japan_day14/adam.jpg' class='fancybox' data-fancybox-group='japan_day14' title='Adam ready to go home.'><img src='http://adamfortuna.com/images/placeholder.gif' data-src='http://s.adamfortuna.com/images/galleries/japan_day14/resized/adam.jpg' /></a></li></ul>


<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p>On our way home we were discussing what things were absolute musts if someone visits Japan. Here&rsquo;s the list Marilyn and I came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re a Ghibli fan, go to the Ghibli museum. This isn&rsquo;t even a question.</li>
<li>Stay at a ryokan, specially one with a hot mineral bath in your room and half board (breakfast + dinner).</li>
<li>See Nara. There&rsquo;s plenty to do to spend a day there.</li>
<li>Explore Harajuku. Between the eclectic stores, Yoyogi park, the Meiji shrine and delicious food, this was our favorite area in Tokyo.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>Most of the photos here were taken by <a href="https://twitter.com/mismamari">Marilyn</a>, and came out better than my iPhone photos. Some are iPhone photos, but at fullsize, the differnce is obvious between a DSLR and an iPhone.</p>

<p>Some of the format of this post was inspired by <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/photos/japan/two-weeks-in-japan/">Paul Stamatiou&rsquo;s</a> photo post about Japan.</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/seeking-mentors/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-11T22:07:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/seeking-mentors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I stumbled upon an interesting blog post about <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2014/01/07/how-to-be-a-mentor/">How to Be a Mentor</a> that included a variety of great advice on the subject. It occurred to me how many tips I could take and also how many mentors I&rsquo;ve sought out in just the past year or two.</p>

<h2>Fitness</h2>

<p>One of the major advantages to something like <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/2-years-of-crossfit">CrossFit</a> is the personalized coaching. Getting a training session with an extremely experienced trainer 3-5 times a week isn&rsquo;t something that seems unusual. More days than not I start the day with a challenge from Mike, Josh or Jason.</p>

<h3>Olympic Lifting</h3>

<p>Recently I started attending an Olympic Lifting class at the gym, with a focus on a few select movements &mdash; clean, jerk, front squat and snatch. The coach for it, <a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/about/about-the-trainers/">Mike Koenig</a> has been an amazing trainer over the last 2 years I&rsquo;ve been working with him, and I&rsquo;m excited to see how the added emphasis on these lifts helps my progress.</p>

<h3>Yoga</h3>

<p>Another unlikely addition to my fitness regime over the past year has been adding in a dash of yoga. Every Wednesday at Envy Labs, we push the ping pong table aside and do a yoga session. <a href="http://www.orlandopoweryoga.com/orlando-power-yoga-instructors.php">Courtney Singleton</a> has been an amazing instructor at easing me into the yoga world, in a non-sweaty introductory way that has helped my flexibility, and surely my performance in other fitness aspects as well.</p>

<p>After I strained my ankle a little over a year ago, yoga was one form of exercise that felt best for it. By Wednesday I&rsquo;m somewhat sore from working out, so having yoga mid week has helped as a recovery tool.</p>

<h3>Running</h3>

<p>Around the office, it&rsquo;s been <a href="http://happymediumblog.com/">Aimee Simone</a> who has continually helped bring people together for runs &ndash; often around downtown Orlando. The path around Lake Eola is a beautiful run, and this time of year it&rsquo;s something to take advantage of. Aimee also spearheaded the Yoga initiative which is always accepting new members.</p>

<h2>Piano</h2>

<p>Growing up, I remember going to my flute lessons in my karate gi. I didn&rsquo;t play flute for too long, maybe 2 or 3 years, but left always wanting to play piano. My dad was always an inspiration to me in the area of music. Throughout my early years, the house was filled with piano or guitar strings, which I came to love waking up to.</p>

<p>Last year I decided to take the plunge and buy an electric piano and find myself a teacher. I&rsquo;d put this off for quite a while mostly because I know it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;ll happen overnight. For the last year I&rsquo;ve been attending classes with <a href="http://www.gardenmusiconline.com/">Al</a> at Winter Garden Music near my house. Al&rsquo;s the kind of guy who you&rsquo;d give any piece of music to and he&rsquo;ll play through it verbatim on the first run through. With his help and encouragement, I&rsquo;m slowly improving, but I have a long ways to go.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>When it comes to programming, there&rsquo;s something you can learn from everyone you meet, so it&rsquo;s impossible to list out any kind of complete list of mentors. My coworkers at Envy Labs push me to learn, teach and grow, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/eallam">Eric Allam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/caike">Carlos Souza</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/greggpollack">Gregg Pollack</a>.</p>

<p>Not all mentors are as hands on as the in person list above. Some mentors are idea creators and code writers who you interact with through the product of their work. Ever since stumbling on <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a> and <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">Learnable Programming</a>, I&rsquo;ve been following (stalking?) <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a>. I&rsquo;m reasonably sure it&rsquo;s normal to have Google Alerts setup for whenever his name is mentioned.</p>

<p>Working at <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> and always trying to push the envelope when it comes to how we teach, just seeing these kinds of inspirational ideas helps immensely. Following the specific approaches Bret mentions isn&rsquo;t the important takeaway, but attempting to understand a concept from a students perspective and giving the tools for them to feel powerful when learning is an important goal to strive for.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working my way through his lengthly list of <a href="http://worrydream.com/Links2013/">Links 2013</a>, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading all of them.</p>

<h2>Seeking Mentors</h2>

<p>One interest I mentioned in my <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/2013-year-in-review">2013 Year In Review</a> post was my desire to dive deeper into the JavaScript world. Part is this is reading through more JavaScript code by other people. If you&rsquo;re reading this and come across any interesting JavaScript code or blog posts the year, feel free send them my way. If for no other reason than it&rsquo;s more material to cover on the <a href="http://five-js.envylabs.com/">5 Minutes of JavaScript</a> podcast Carlos and I have been releasing every Thursday.</p>

<p>Seeking out mentors doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Finding programming mentors may be difficult outside of the workplace, but most people I talk are more than willing to guide people &ndash; just no one asks. If you respect someone and want advice, don&rsquo;t be shy to ask them.</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/2013-year-in-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/2013-year-in-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my annual recap of what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last year. I&rsquo;ve come to realize every 5th or 6th year is extremely active, while the other years seem to be less so. This year was not one of those 5/6 years, but instead more about personal growth and finding balance in my life. The biggest parts of my life this year were: Marilyn, Code School, CrossFit, audiobooks, learning Ember.js, and learning Piano.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t travel all that much this year. The biggest trips were Rails Conf and WWDC &ndash; both week long conferences attended with coworkers.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://railsconf.com/">Rails Conf</a> in Portland, OR</li>
<li>Was extremely lucky to attend <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/wwdc">WWDC</a> in San Francisco</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/365957862113021952">Sanibel</a> with Marilyn for her birthday weekend</li>
<li>Went to Miami for <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/404414324401520641">Distant Worlds</a>, a Final Fantasy Concert</li>
</ul>


<h2>Events and Entertainment</h2>

<p>The most random event this year was Distant Worlds. Marilyn and I were discussing &ldquo;What musical acts would you absolutely love to see that you haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and I mentioned Nobuo Uematsu, the composer behind the Final Fantasy games. After looking to see if he had a tour coming up, there was one in Miami 2 months out. Considering he&rsquo;s only performed in the US 10 times in 10+ years, we really lucked out!</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>If you like movies, I’d encourage you to create a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> account and friend me!</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Saw a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/year/2013/">load of movies</a>, my favorites for the year being: Somm, Gravity and Stoker</li>
<li>Went to the Florida Film Festival Premiere, followed by seeing a number of awesome movies</li>
<li>Attended Megacon for the 15th straight year</li>
<li>Lots of <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books">audiobooks</a> &mdash; 45 total for the year. My favorites were Hyperion, Maphead, His Dark Materials and Bossypants. Many more were amazing.</li>
<li>The TV Shows I looked forward to most this year were Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Homeland and Breaking Bad</li>
<li>Went to <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/335839768439029761">BarCampOrlando</a> and presented on &ldquo;R Programming for Ruby and Rails Developers&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Postal Service concert viewed from the balcony at Hard Rock</li>
<li>A hilarious Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine concert at House of Blues</li>
<li>Saw Kevin Smith live at the Plaza Theater</li>
<li>Distant Worlds Concert</li>
<li>Only played a few video games, including more Skyrim, Final Fantasy VI, Bioshock and Final Fantasy XII</li>
</ul>


<h2>Body</h2>

<p>2011 was about having fun and keeping interested (when it comes to CrossFit). This year was more about testing my limits and seeing how I could improve. Towards the end of the year I did start to plateau when it comes to working out. I suspect it was due to an awful diet and lack of sleep.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://adamfortuna.com/2-years-of-crossfit">Worked out</a> usually around 3 or 4 times a week, nearly always at 8am</li>
<li>Stopped by <a href="http://www.crossfitportland.com/">CrossFit Portland</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/yeabuddy">Casey</a> when in town for Rails Conf</li>
<li>Participated in the <a href="http://evaleverything.com/2013/11/12/xkcd-style-graphs-with-r/">CrossFit Open</a> with a few other people to see how I matched up. My best performance was in the 20% percentile, but most were in the 4%</li>
<li>Continued doing yoga at work on Wednesdays. Great way to relax and prevent injury</li>
<li>Did <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000881.html">Murph</a> in 51:17 for Memorial Day. Confident I can do better next time!</li>
<li>Ran in a <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/297775932167553024">Warrior Dash</a> outside of Orlando with a few friends. Muddy and cold, but a load of fun</li>
<li>Running around Lake Eola in downtown Orlando after work occasionally when not too hot out</li>
</ul>


<div class='pull-right '><p>The FitBit is awesome, but it doesn’t understand how much I hate wall balls.</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Got a FitBit for Christmas, with the hope of monitoring my sleep patterns and general fitness. When I keep track of things, they generally get better.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Work</h2>

<p>Worked at <a href="http://envylabs.com">Envy Labs</a> entirely on <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> all year long. My main focus has been on putting out awesome courses and trying to improve education through technology.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Work mantra: always ask “What Would Bret Victor Do?”</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Changed job titles to &ldquo;Technical Director at Code School&rdquo;, whatever that means.</li>
<li>Helped released a ton of Code School courses over the last year. A total of 17 went out in 2013</li>
<li>Helped write and worked on <a href="http://try.jquery.com">Try jQuery</a>, a free way to learn jQuery in the browser (and linked to from the jQuery site). Followed up by writing <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/jquery-the-return-flight">jQuery: The Return Flight</a></li>
<li>Helped write the Ruby/JavaScript side of Code Schools <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/core-ios-7">Core iOS 7</a> course, which lead to a few <a href="http://evaleverything.com/2013/10/04/teaching-ios-7-at-codeschool/">blog posts</a> about it</li>
<li>Wrote and helped implement <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs">Warming up with Emberjs</a>, a course to learn Ember.js from scratch. Basing the implemention on everything we&rsquo;d learned about teaching programming in the browser.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Great Meals</h2>

<p>I tend to remember amazing meals far longer than I probably should. Here&rsquo;s a few that stand out.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Having coffee at Victoria &amp; Alberts is a magical experience.</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Went to <a href="http://victoria-alberts.com/">Victoria &amp; Alberts</a> restaurant with Marilyn for our Anniversary</li>
<li>Had a great birthday dinner with Cask and Larder with Marilyn, my Dad and Paige</li>
<li>The Chefs Table of Edgewater for mothers day with Marilyns family</li>
<li>Went to Cask &amp; Larder for an Envy Labs lunch</li>
<li>The Chefs Table of Edgewater dinner with Alli and Jeff</li>
<li>Had Marilyns Birthday dinner at Pharmacy with tons of friends</li>
<li>Stone Crab Festival in St. Pete with Nate and so many friends</li>
<li>Food and Wine Festival with the Envy Labs gang</li>
</ul>


<h2>Personal</h2>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Seriously, the little girl in the Piano lesson after mine is soo much better than me.</p>
</div>


<ul>
<li>Bought an electric piano and started taking lessons every week. Still not very good, but making progress</li>
<li>Cleaned out and organized the garage and attic to where we actually know where things are</li>
<li>Launched a programming blog called <a href="http://evaleverything.com/">eval everything</a>, where I&rsquo;ve been writing about anything technical topics that are interesting</li>
<li>Updated this blog from it&rsquo;s previous setup!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>Looks like I&rsquo;m in the <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/">45% of people who make New Years resolutions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Continue learning piano</strong>. For me this means doing more practice at home as well as keeping up with lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Get into Angular.js development</strong>, which we&rsquo;re using for a new Code School project. Kind of have to do this one for work anyways, but I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do it too.</p>

<p><strong>Get more into JavaScript testing frameworks</strong> out there. I&rsquo;ve let my JavaScript go untested for far too long.</p>

<p><strong>Invite friends over more</strong>, typically to play games or anything really. Too many times this year we said &ldquo;we need to have a game night&rdquo;. If you ever want to have a game night, just let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Keep track of things more</strong>. Kind of an obvious one, but &ldquo;What gets measured gets improved&rdquo; has always been true for me. I&rsquo;m already doing these &mdash; some all the time, some intermittently.</p>

<ul>
<li>My Todo list in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></li>
<li>Workouts and fitness goals in Evernote</li>
<li>Piano practice in Evernote</li>
<li>Audiobooks in my <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books">book log</a></li>
<li>Sleep in FitBit</li>
<li>Expenses in Google Docs</li>
<li>Weight via <a href="http://www.withings.com/en/scales">Withings</a></li>
<li>Monthly goals in Evernote</li>
</ul>


<p>Confident that 2014 will be an amazing year!</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/2-years-of-crossfit/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-01T12:04:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/2-years-of-crossfit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of November 1st, I will have been doing <a href="http://crossfit.com/">CrossFit</a> for 2 years. What started as a casual twice a week workout, slowly grew up to four and sometimes even 5 workouts a week. It&rsquo;s been an amazing, life changing experience that I bring up in conversation entirely too often. 2 years seems like as good a time as any to reflect and detail my experience so far.</p>

<h2>Fitness Background</h2>

<p>Earlier in life I used to work out often. I had a good routine of jogging in the morning, and weight training after work a few days a week. This went well, but I didn&rsquo;t love it. This routine was thrown off when I changed jobs and I spent nearly 3 years doing absolutely nothing that required raising my heart rate.</p>

<p>That might have continued if not for my friend and coworker <a href="http://caseyjenks.com/">Casey Jenks</a> who co-founded <a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/">CrossFit Kings Point</a>. After a few months of hearing about this CrossFit thing, I decided to check it out.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Box: Term for a local CrossFit affiliate</p>
</div>


<p>So let&rsquo;s say you want to try out CrossFit. What should you expect? Well, after joining a local box, there&rsquo;s a period where you&rsquo;re learning an entire new vocabulary and trying new movements every week. I started slow, at only 2 days a week. 2 days a week is better than 0, and getting a sustainable routine is an important step.</p>

<div class='pull-left '><p>CrossFit Kings Point</p>
</div>




<div class='pull-panorama '><p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/images/2-years-of-crossfit/gym.png" alt="Inside CrossFit Kings Point" /></p>
</div>


<h3>Your First Day</h3>

<div class='pull-left '><p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/images/2-years-of-crossfit/kingspoint.png" alt="Core iOS 7" class="icon" /></p>
</div>


<p><a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/">CrossFit Kings Point</a> and most CrossFit gyms start people off with some type of &ldquo;On Ramp&rdquo; program. The way it currently works is you come in for your initial workout and you&rsquo;re paired with a trainer in a small class, possibly even alone, and taken through all the exercises for the day. A typical workout might look something like this:</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>EMOM: Every minute on the minute
AMRAP: As many rounds as possible</p>
</div>




<blockquote><p>Strength: Weighted Pull Ups<br/>3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3<br/>Rest 2 Minutes between Sets<br/>Or<br/>10 Minute EMOM of Muscle Ups<br/>(Based on your ability)</p><p>Then, 7 Minute AMRAP<br/>7 Burpees<br/>7 Pull-Ups<br/>7 Box Jumps (24/20)</p></blockquote>




<div class='pull-right '><p>WOD: Workout of the day</p>
</div>


<p>Going into your first day can be intimidating, but having someone there walk you through it can be amazing for getting started. For something like this, you&rsquo;ll learn about the structure of the workout &mdash; namely that there will be a skill portion where you&rsquo;re moving slow but working on strength, followed by a WOD where you you&rsquo;re moving fast for 7 minutes.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d learn about using bands for pullups which provide additional help if you&rsquo;re unable to do body weight pull ups. The trainer would also walk you through the individual movements, showing you what it means to do a burpee, a pull-up and a box jump.</p>

<p>Every gym has a different way of introducing new members to fitness, so check out how the gym near you structures your first days and weeks.</p>

<h3>My First Day</h3>

<div class='pull-right '><p>CrossFit has many named workouts that you can use as a benchmark for your progress.</p>
</div>


<p>My first workout was a &ldquo;Half Cindy&rdquo;, which consisted of doing 5 pull-ups, 10 pushups and 15 squats in that series over and over for 10 minutes (an AMRAP). Even with the assistance of a band, I struggled to not throw up after 5 rounds. Even with that awkward feeling, it felt amazing. I scheduled my next workout immediately and didn&rsquo;t look back.</p>

<p>On a side note, wecently we did &ldquo;Cindy&rdquo;, which is the same workout, but over 20 minutes. I managed 17 rounds this time, without using a band. Amazing to be able to look back. Maybe in another year, that number will be 20 &mdash; or more?</p>

<h2>Avoiding Injuries</h2>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Bouldering: Rock climbing on a wall no higher than 12ft without a rope.</p>
</div>


<p>In 2 years, I&rsquo;ve had 2 injuries, and only one was CrossFit related. I strained my ankle bouldering and couldn&rsquo;t run for a month. In that time I continued working out, but instead of running, I&rsquo;d row. Other ankle related movements, like squats, weren&rsquo;t a problem. Workouts can always be scaled back based on injuries if you make it clear with the trainer.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>I’m not counting torn hands, bruises or scrapped knees as injuries.</p>
</div>


<p>My only CrossFit related injury was on such a light, simple movement, it&rsquo;s hard to believe it ended up with me not being unable to walk straight for 3 weeks. I was doing a stiff legged deadlift with a light 56 lb kettlebell as a warmup, and on the way up I heard my back crack. I knew right away something was wrong and I had to lay down and limit my movement right away. My trainer (Mike), insisted I sit out and stretch rather than participate in the workout. Within half an hour I could barely move without intense pain.</p>

<p>I managed to get it looked at that day, which lead to some pain medicine for it, followed by a massage. Luckily for me it was nothing serious &mdash; just a back strain. My back was a persistant spasmed state for a number of weeks, but I was able to return to working out after a week and a half off by adjusting the workouts for my limitations.</p>

<h2>Diet</h2>

<p>When it comes to diet, there&rsquo;s always two &mdash; what you aim for and what actually happens. I go through periods of focus with my diet, which generally lead to larger gains. Between them is my usual, mostly-healthy diet.</p>

<h3>Paleo</h3>

<div class='pull-right '><p>There may or may not be shirtless before/after pictures of me for this Paleo Challenge.</p>
</div>


<p>For the month of August 2012, I participated in a &ldquo;<a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/paleo-challenge-results/">Paleo Challenge</a>&rdquo; competition run by my gym. The goal was to eat no grains, sugars, salt, vinegar, rice, chocolate &mdash; or other things considered non-paleo for the month. This generally meant eating meats, vegetables, fruits, nuts, olive oil and not much else. I cut out fruit as well to try to lower my sugar intake even lower.</p>

<p>The result of this was that I went down from 8.2% to 6.8% body fat over the course of a month. At 132lbs, that&rsquo;s almost surely the slimest I&rsquo;ll ever be in my life. At that rediculously small size, I didn&rsquo;t have any visible 6-pack. Genetics still plays a factor in something like that.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t follow paleo now, although I do tend to eat more meat and less sugar than the average person. Some things, like salt, are annoyingly difficult to limit, and the occasional beer/wine throughout the week is still an indulgence. The biggest takeaway from the paleo education is understanding how different foods affect my energy level, moods and training goals.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked about weight all that much because it hasn&rsquo;t been a goal of mine. Going into my first workout I weighed around 155lbs. My first 10 months ended up shedding 20lbs of that going three times a week. In the year since then, I&rsquo;ve managed to put that amount back on, mostly as muscle.</p>

<p>During this time, I&rsquo;ve never had a &ldquo;goal weight&rdquo;. Instead I&rsquo;ve aimed for periods of eating a caloric deficit, followed by periods of eating a surplus.</p>

<h2>Tracking Progress</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t plan on doing CrossFit at any kind of competitive level, but I do enjoy pushing myself and seeing improvements over time. I&rsquo;m securely in the &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; tier on the arbitrary <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-journal/WLSTANDARDS.pdf">CrossFit Strength Standards</a> document for my weight in all movements.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>I really want to do something with the Evernote API for tracking personal bests, volume and progress.</p>
</div>


<p>For tracking my own progress, I create a new <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> note for each day, and tag it with each movement, and the name of the workout if there is one. Pulling up previous times and maxes on a given lift are as easy as looking at other notes with that tag. I&rsquo;ve been keeping a single <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/973a96d9-aa87-47d3-9f85-04de242891a5/24a64823dbfba5d6f83e918706cbdf55">Max Lifts</a> note containing my current progress as a quick reference.</p>

<h3>The Open</h3>

<p>One other way of tracking progress is participating in The Open, the very base level of competition. The Open consists of 5 workouts that you perform at your local gym. Every athlete around the world performs the exact same workouts, with the same weights, which allows for a global ranking. The top 30ish in each region participate in &ldquo;Regionals&rdquo; where they do a few more workouts. The top 3 from each region then move on to &ldquo;The Games&rdquo;. This is the big event that&rsquo;s broadcast on ESPN each summer.</p>

<p>There is a huge thrill in being the same starting pool as those who go onto to The Games, even if it&rsquo;s a completely different level. It&rsquo;s similar to the US Open Golf tournament where anyone can participate, but the amazing thing about The Open is how many people join due to its distributed nature &mdash; 150,000.</p>

<p>For the last 2 years I participated, even though in both cases still a beginner. During the 2nd year I analyzed my progress and progress to compare against the field at large. The result? I was in somewhere between the 4% and 21% percentile for all of the workouts. I&rsquo;m already looking forward to seeing how I compare next year!</p>

<h2>Finding Friends</h2>

<p>One of the biggest surprises about starting CrossFit was making so many friends. After 2 years at LA Fitness, the longest conversation I had with anyone was &ldquo;Are you done here?&rdquo;. At the gym I go to, there are other regulars at the 8am class I attend, which has lead to meeting smart and driven people that I wake up to each day. That&rsquo;s not to mention the amazing trainers who help shape your progress and provide inspiration.</p>

<p>Being a developer and tending to find myself at developer events and developer conferences, spending time with people outside my profession has refreshing. The group I&rsquo;ve come to know includes trainers, chefs, salespeople, flight attendants, former gymnists, students, parents, and too many more to list. Ages range dramatically from teens up to 60s and higher. During many, if not most classes, there are more women than men.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Worth every penny.</p>
</div>


<p>Tim Dikun, a coworker, friend and fellow CrossFitter, mentioned the biggest diversity gap in his <a href="http://timdikun.com/journal/2013/02-crossfit-year-in-review/">CrossFit Year in Review</a> post: income. CrossFit isn&rsquo;t cheap. While a month at 24h Fitness is $10, a month at a CrossFit gym will run somewhere around $150/month or more.</p>

<h2>Try It Out!</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trying out CrossFit, don&rsquo;t be intimidated. Everyone is a beginner at some point and knows what it feels like. I&rsquo;ve never talked to anyone at the gym that didn&rsquo;t greet me with smiles.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/wwdc</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the Apple development world, there aren&rsquo;t many public conferences. This is unlike the Ruby community which has local events throughout the country, with lots of international ones thrown in the mix. Apple, on the other hand, limits their exposure to a single week in June known as WWDC, Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, held in San Francisco.</p>

<p>In past years, we&rsquo;ve seen the launch of devices by Steve Jobs like the iPhone and the iPad. Iconic moments like the reveal of the MacBook Air by pulling it out of a manilla envelope while popularizing the phrase &ldquo;One more thing&hellip;&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Keynote&rdquo; as this event is dubbed, is the only public event at WWDC, and kicks off an entire week of developer targetted talks. I was lucky enough to have <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> send me, <a href="https://twitter.com/eallam">Eric Allam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonfriskics">Jon Friskics</a> out west this year to experience this amazing event.</p>

<h2>Tickets</h2>

<p>Even getting tickets to WWDC is a bit of a miracle. With only 5,000 tickets and something in the neighborhood of 3,000,000 Apple Developers, there&rsquo;s a competition for tickets. In past years, Apple opened ticket sales at a random hour on a random day, and only at that time was the date for WWDC set. This year they did something different &ndash; they announced the date for the event a few days ahead of time, and gave the date and time tickets would go on sale.</p>

<p>Once tickets went on sale, the downside of this approach became obvious. Apple doesn&rsquo;t make it public how many people tried to get tickets, but they did publicize the fact that tickets sold out in 71 seconds. The 3 of us at Code School were refreshing the ticket sales page when 1:00pm came around.</p>

<p>We were able to add the ticket to our cart, enter our credit card information, and submit it. All of us got a 500 error, indicating that something went wrong on the server side. When we refreshed the page, we saw a message indicating that tickets were sold out.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in the details, Eric wrote up <a href="http://initwithfunk.com/blog/2013/05/26/the-case-of-the-wwdc-sellout/">an analysis of this record sellout</a> .
Lucky for us, Apple gave us all a call individually 6 hours later, letting us know that a ticket was still reserved for us, and we still had a chance to buy it! 2 days later we had actual tickets!</p>

<p>If you know Portuegese, you can read more about this in an interview we gave: <a href="http://uoltecnologia.blogosfera.uol.com.br/2013/06/10/wwdc-2013-americanos-contam-perrengue-para-comprar-ingressos-do-evento-da-apple/">WWDC 2013: americanos contam perrengue para comprar ingressos do evento da Apple</a></p>

<h2>San Francisco</h2>

<p>Having enough appetites are always a problem when in SF.</p>

<h2>Keynote</h2>

<p>Having never been to a WWDC, we heard a variety of things about the Keynote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be packed! If you want to get in, you shoule be in line by 6:00am.&rdquo;. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an overflow room, and if you get there late, you&rsquo;ll have to watch it on screens there instead&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With this fresh in our minds, we joined the keynote line that wrapped around Moscone Center at 5:45am Monday morning. Not surprisingly for an Apple event, the line had already formed at 4:00pm previous day when we stopped by to get our conference badges. By 7am people were heading inside the building, and able to at least get some coffee and food. At 9am they started letting people into the (very large) room.</p>

<p>Unlike what the rumors said, there was plenty of space for everyone. We were sitting next to someone who got up at 9am and walked in at 9:30.</p>

<h3>Announcements</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not too enthusiastic about anything that was announced this year <em>in the keynote</em>. There&rsquo;s interesting stuff announced elsewhere, and not to say things are bad, just nothing was in the &ldquo;wow, that&rsquo;s amazing, I can&rsquo;t wait!&rdquo; category. If I was pining for a Mac Pro I might have a different opinion, but I value mobility more than power.</p>

<p>The announcement that was most useful to me was the ability to have full screen applications on multiple monitors in OSX Mavericks, which I can say is actually pretty awesome. Other than that, here&rsquo;s my rapid fire opinion on the rest of it:</p>

<h4>OSX Mavericks</h4>

<p>Lots of small and useful changes for the most part. Been using it a week now myself, and like it. It&rsquo;s not going to change your entire world, but it&rsquo;ll make things a little easier and better. In addition to better battery life, the fact that apps that are using a lot of power show up in the battery pulldown is one of the biggest changes. If an application I wrote showed up in that menu, I&rsquo;d have a lot of incentive to fix it &mdash; or be shamed everytime someone saw it.</p>

<h4>iOS 7</h4>

<p>eh. It&rsquo;s a beta. We&rsquo;ll see what happens. Design wise though, I&rsquo;m hoping things change. I put the beta on my phone the Monday it was released, and despite a few surprises, it&rsquo;s been a stable release. The occasional app isn&rsquo;t compatible with it now, but that&rsquo;s to be expected. Control Center is very useful. The multitasking interface used to switch and close apps is a good improvement. The new tab view in safari is painful to use. iTunes Radio will guarentee I don&rsquo;t renew my Pandora subscription. Game controllers sound awesome, I&rsquo;m looking forward to see what people come up with for that. Some of the location awareness features are also intriguing.</p>

<h4>Hardware</h4>

<p>The new MacBook Air isn&rsquo;t much different. I understand why it&rsquo;s not retina &ndash; so it can continue to be their baseline notebook. It also guarentees I won&rsquo;t get one. The Mac Pro is not for me, but still an impressive machine. Curious to see what affect it has on the high end design world.</p>

<h4>Favorite Sessions</h4>

<p>One of the nice parts of the Apple Developer program (which costs $99/year), is that they record all of the talks given each year and make them available on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2012/">Developer Session Videos</a> page.</p>

<p>Apple makes it very clear that things discussed in these talks, and in every session outside of the keynote, is off limits for public discussion. Before every talk they announce this, and also mention that no pictures or recording is allowed &mdash; not to mention posters throughout the convention center mentioning this fact. In other words &ndash; if you want to see what&rsquo;s launching beyond what is mentioned in the keynote, you need to join the Apple Developer Program.</p>

<p>The session videos were available the very next day after they were presented. Considering they had about 25 videos posted each day, that&rsquo;s impressive. What happens at WWDC apparently has to stay at WWDC, but if you&rsquo;re a developer, you should watch the following videos:</p>

<ul>
<li>Platforms State of the Union</li>
<li>Exploring Scroll Views on iOS 7</li>
<li>Getting Started with UIKit Dynamics</li>
<li>Hidden Gems in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch</li>
<li>Designing Games with Sprite Kit</li>
<li>Advances in Objective-C</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to being able to download and watch these on your computer, Apple released an iPhone/iPad application that allows you to stream these talks straight to your device.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

<p>After going to primarily Ruby conferences for the past few years, this one had a very different feel. The biggest difference to me is the open vs closed source aspect. At Ruby conferences, most talks are about things people have built, or problems they have solved &mdash; perhaps mentioning some open source tools they used to accomplish their task. WWDC is more about letting the (registered developer) public see what Apple is providing.</p>

<p>Being able to hear about these coming features in person and be inspired by the energy of the event left me much more enthusiastic about developing than just watching the videos at home like last year.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My yearly recap of what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last year. Looking back on this year, it was much less active than <a href="http://blog.adamfortuna.com/2011-year-in-review/">last year</a>. Most life changing events of the year would probably by Marilyn and my trip to Europe, having fun getting fit and trying to tackle more difficult problems at work (or at home).</p>

<h3>Body</h3>

<p>Fitness was a fun priority this past year. It was less about pushing limits and more about finding ways to have fun that kept me coming back.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/">Worked out</a> at least 3x every week I was physically able to.</li>
<li>Got a Lasik adjustment in both my eyes, bringing them a little closer to 20/20</li>
<li>Strained my ankle rock climbing at Rails Conf in late April, took 3 months to heal to the point where I no longer felt pain</li>
<li>Ate mostly paleo (some surplus, some deficit) to help build a bit more muscle</li>
<li>Started doing yoga at work thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/aimee_simone">Aimee</a> organizing it</li>
<li>Dropped down to about 7% body fat during a month long paleo challenge at the gym before returning to a more stable weight</li>
<li>Started playing Ultimate Frisbee again, this time in the competitive league</li>
<li>Running more, including many runs around lake Eola with the EnvyLabs gang</li>
<li>Strained my back during a workout, causing me to barely be able to stand up or walk for 2 weeks</li>
</ul>


<h3>Work</h3>

<ul>
<li>Awesome year working at <a href="http://envylabs.com">EnvyLabs</a> mostly on <a href="http://codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a></li>
<li>Had one very crazy week where I worked 85 hours (including 24 hours straight), went to 3 fancy dinners for <a href="http://forkful.net">Marilyn&rsquo;s blog</a> and still hit the gym 3 times</li>
<li>Involved in some way of releasing a number of educational courses for <a href="http://codeschool.com">CodeSchool</a> on a variety of topics including <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/journey-into-mobile">mobile web</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/anatomy-of-backbonejs">backbone.js</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec">RSpec</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass">Sass</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r">R</a>, and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ios">iOS</a></li>
<li>Rolled out a new framework for CodeSchool courses that allows more flexibility in how we implement them. Really looking forward to improving on this in the new year</li>
</ul>


<h3>Personal</h3>

<ul>
<li>This year I did a lot of throw away projects &mdash; projects I worked on for a week or two then completely abandon</li>
<li>Bought a Retina Macbook Pro, upgrading my 5 year old 17&#8221; MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Took an iOS Programming course at Valencia Community College to keep myself on track education wise</li>
<li>Moved off Bank Of America, and loving Simple so far</li>
<li>Had a break in where they stole our TV and Marilyns jewelry box while I was in Austin. Luckily Marilyn was gone at the time and Lily was OK</li>
<li>Lost our cat of 6+ years, Loverboy. He was always an outdoor cat, and lived to be at least 11 years old before disappearing. We can still hope that he was adopted</li>
<li>Made some improvements to the backyard including a low fence and lighting that makes being out back more fun</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>This coming year is the first that I won&rsquo;t have any kind of fitness/diet related goals. I&rsquo;m happy with where I am there, so just a matter of keeping the habits that have been built up. I&rsquo;m not a fan of making resolutions in general, but more listing out what my current objectives are and where I&rsquo;m trying to change my current behavior. At the moment this includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Spend even less time watching TV and reading junk (reddit, hacker news)</li>
<li>Be more conscious of my time in general</li>
<li>Spend more time with friends and family</li>
<li>More time working on non-computer related projects (garden, house improvements, etc)</li>
</ul>


<p>We really have no plans whatsoever for the upcoming year right now, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to it!</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/uncluttering-manifesto/"/>
    <updated>2012-06-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/uncluttering-manifesto</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In college, and shortly thereafter, I wasn&rsquo;t the best with  money. I spent entirely too much needlessly upgrading my computer to the latest hardware for no real reason. Like many who come into some funds with a first job after college, I wasn&rsquo;t the most thoughtful about where I spent my money. It didn&rsquo;t take too long for that to change though.</p>

<h2>A Catalyst</h2>

<p>Three months after I graduated college, my mom unexpectedly passed away. The entire next year of my life was spent driving two hours each weekend to her now empty house and going through her lifes posessions and looking back on the home I  grew up in for 22 years. During this time I made the decision to save a great many posessions of hers that I couldn&rsquo;t push myself to part with. Still today I am sorting through this inheritance deciding what I want to keep for the rest of my life, and what is a memory I can save without the physical representation.</p>

<p>Since then one goal on my mind has been to go through and minimize the clutter in my life. This applies both to my thoughts on acquiring new stuff, and getting rid of anything unused. For instance, for every physical book brought home, I make sure at least 3 are removed. I try to follow a similar approach for everything I bring home &ndash; with the goal that whenever I bring something home for good, I donate or sell something to offset the addition.</p>

<h2>Collecting Experiences</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re not going to find many who disagree with the sentiment that experiences and relationships are the most important part of life. In my own experience it is easier to focus on this when your life is in order. In my case that meant fixing up and selling my moms old house, as well as simplifying my schedule to only those things that mattered most to me. I&rsquo;ve found the less clutter I have in my life, the more open I am to new experiences.</p>

<p>The end result of all this is that as you become more restrictive when it comes to acquiring posessions, you can become more open when it comes to new experiences.</p>

<h2>A Challenge</h2>

<p>How many things do you own that you could get rid of? Do you think you could elimate enough possessions to where you were down to 100 things? If so, you might want to attempt the <a href="http://guynameddave.com/about-the-100-thing-challenge/">100 Thing Challenge</a>. The idea is simple &mdash; elimate clutter from your life to the point where you only own 100 things (though some things you could own multiple copies of &mdash; like shirts or pants.</p>

<p>Do you think you can make it down to 100 things? Do you think it would make you happier?</p>

<p>As for goals for the new year? For most of this past year I was setting goals in smaller increments and working towards them, which I&rsquo;d like to do more of. It&rsquo;s great for developing a routine without too much overthinking.  Most things I want to do in the new year are already in progress &mdash; going to CrossFit more, working on (and using) the budgeting app, learning more iOS development, uncluttering the house and bringing in more color. Other than that, I&rsquo;d like to be more social in the new year, and spend less time watching TV.</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/write-your-year-in-review-now/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last year, I wrote a post about <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/2010-year-in-review/">what I&#8217;d been up to in the past year</a>. I do this every year (though usually unpublished) while things are still fresh in my mind, and find it fun to look back on the highlights and see what I was able to accomplish. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;d recommend to anyone.</p>
<p>Rather than writing this post at the end of year, why not try writing it a few months early? You might have a number of &#8220;new years resolutions&#8221; from eight months ago that need some reassessment, and now is the time! Go through everything you want to get done before the end of the year and write them down in a post as though you have already done them. Next, take the next steps to accomplish those tasks.</p>
<p>For me this called out a few things I really wanted to do this year that I haven&#8217;t made enough progress on. Cleaning out my garage, getting an iPhone app in the app store and any kind of exercise come to mind. Time to get crackin&#8217; on those!</p>]]></content>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[My LASIK Experience]]></title>
    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/my-lasik-experience/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/my-lasik-experience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, June 23, 2011 at about 11:30am, I had LASIK. It took years of coming to terms with the idea that if something failed I may end up blind for the rest of my life. Having come through the procedure successfully, and with practically no issues whatsoever so far, I wanted to give a basic heads up on what&rsquo;s involved in having LASIK, and what you should expect based on my experiences.</p>

<h2>Consultation (~ half hour)</h2>

<p>Choosing a place to have LASIK is the only decision you&rsquo;ll have to make. For me, I polled some friends to see where they had been and 2 here in Orlando suggested <a href="http://www.laservueorlando.com/">Dr. Magruder</a> &mdash; including one who had successfully had LASIK there the year before. An optometrist friend of mine suggested the same place, and for me that settled it.</p>

<p>Consultations are typically free, so this the time to shop around if you want to. Prior to talking with the doctor that will be doing the procedure, you will have eyes mapped out, your prescription checked and your tear generation measured. These measurements, coupled with a few basic questions, let them know if you&rsquo;re a good candidate for LASIK.</p>

<p>The only part that is uncomfortable is the tear generation test. Small tissue-like papers are put under your eyelids and kept there for a minute to measure your body&rsquo;s automatic response. Most people tend to have dryer eyes after LASIK, so if your eyes are already extremely dry according to this test, it&rsquo;s a warning sign.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a candidate for LASIK, you will probably talk to the doctor that will be performing the operation next. In my case Dr. Magruder was extremely personable and seemed to want to stay and keep prodding me for questions to make sure I&rsquo;d asked everything that was on my mind. This the typical part where he&rsquo;ll go over the format of what to expect.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in going forward at this point, you&rsquo;ll end up talking with someone who sets up the appointments. They&rsquo;ll go over the billing details, any discounts or financing available. In the case of the place I went, the procedure would be $5,000, which includes the pre-operation appointment, follow up appointments for a year and any adjustments necessary in the first year. They also offered a $500 discount if you schedule your operation within a month of your consultation (although the discount cannot be used if you use financing).</p>

<p>They listed out some dates they have available, and went over what the next steps would be if I did decide to have the procedure on one of those dates. I didn&rsquo;t feel pressured to make an appointment right then and there &mdash; instead they gave me all the information I&rsquo;d need to make it on my own, and call back to schedule it. I called back and made the appointment a few days later (after Marilyn had confirmed taking a day off to help me).</p>

<h3>Types of LASIK</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASIK">Wikipedia Article on LASIK</a> goes into much more detail, but the two forms flap creation (might want to read the wikipedia article if that term isn&rsquo;t familiar) are either by laser or blade. I went the laser route.</p>

<h3>Wearing Contacts?</h3>

<p>Depending on what type of contacts you wear, you will need to stop wearing them for some time before the actual procedure can be performed. This ranges from 14 days up to 2 months for harder lenses. If you don&rsquo;t wear contacts there is no waiting period required before proceeding</p>

<h2>Homework before the Pre-Operation</h2>

<p>After calling in and scheduling the procedure and the pre-operation, they called in two prescriptions for me to pickup at my local pharmacy along with an over the counter lid cleaner. 7 days before the procedure the lid cleaning began twice a day. The two prescriptions they gave me were:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.drugs.com/cdi/fml-forte.html">FML Forte</a></strong> &ndash; Used for treating inflammation (swelling, warmth, redness, pain) of the eyes and eyelids.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/ofloxacin-ophthalmic_solution/article.htm">Ofloxacin Ophthalmic Solution</a></strong> &ndash; Used to prevent infection</li>
</ul>


<p>Both of these eye drops were started 5 days before the surgery and taken 4 times per day.</p>

<h2>Pre-Operation Exam (2 hours)</h2>

<p>The pre-op is the most intensive eye exam you&rsquo;ve ever had. Think of this way &ndash; if after you have LASIK you discover you have XYZ wrong with your eye, it&rsquo;s difficult to prove if it was a result of the LASIK or not. Their protective response to this is a very long examination of every millimeter of your eye.</p>

<ul>
<li>Re-scan and mapping of your retina</li>
<li>Thorough eye sight test (the &ldquo;which is clearer, #1 or #2?&rdquo; test)</li>
<li>Numbing drops following by measuring your cornea (used for creating the flap later on)</li>
<li>Tests for blind spots in your vision</li>
<li>Eye dilation followed by thorough investigation with a head mounted magnifying glass</li>
</ul>


<p>In the last part, they were able to uncover that have I small holes in the back of my retina, which is why I occasionally have seen floaters in certain parts of my vision. I rarely ever saw these, but it was interesting to know <a href="http://www.bettermedicine.com/article/seeing-spots">the actual cause of them</a>.</p>

<p>After the op is over, you&rsquo;re given the usual sunglass shields (to protect your dilated eyes), and are now set for surgery.</p>

<h2>Operation Day (2 hours total, 5 minutes of action)</h2>

<p>You won&rsquo;t be able to drive home, so you&rsquo;ll need someone to accompany you the day of the procedure. After getting there, they&rsquo;ll go over things once more, and give you instructions on what to do in the time following the procedure. For me this included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t expose your eyes to bright sun.</li>
<li>Go home and sleep for 6 hours.</li>
<li>Take the 2 eye drops you have even more often (FML Forte every 2 hours, Ofloxacin every 4).</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you know what you&rsquo;re in for, they give you a Valium to calm you down. Having never had Valium, I didn&rsquo;t realize just how much this calms you down. After waiting 20 or so minutes, and with absolutely no fear at that point, they led me into the operating room. There are three stages to the procedure, each taking a very short time.</p>

<h3>Creating the flap</h3>

<p>In reading about LASIK, or watching The Discovery Channel, this always looked like the worst part of the procedure. They put a corneal suction ring in place around your eye to hold it in place while using a laser to cut a hole and in your eye and fold it back. While this sounds like a highly invasive part of the process, I actually had to ask the doctor &ldquo;Did you just create the flap?&rdquo;. There was no pain, and no discomfort &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t even know what hit me and the process took only a minute or two.</p>

<p>At the place I went, they had one chair for flap creation and another for the procedure. They led me over to the second chair, but I could still see alright even with the flap created. I imagine this is because I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntraLasik">IntraLASIK</a> rather than the steel blade method.</p>

<h3>The Procedure</h3>

<p>After laying down in the chair they lowered a large machine down over one eye at a time. They asked me to stare directly at the green light at the very center while the red lasers that took up most of my vision did the work. At this point my vision became so blurry that all I could make out with a red haze, but I tried to keep my focus on where I thought the green light used to be. The equipment is smart enough to track your eye to impressive accuracy (4,000 times per second), so it&rsquo;ll stabilize for minor movements. Do you know that smell when you&rsquo;re at the dentist having your teeth drilled? During this stage I was able to smell the same thing.</p>

<p>My perception of time might be off, but the entire procedure couldn&rsquo;t have taken longer than 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>Repositioning the Flap</h3>

<p>After everything is set, the doctor took what felt like a very damp paint brush and lightly brushed the flap closed. This only took a few seconds.</p>

<h2>Immediately After the Operation</h2>

<p>I kept my eyes closed for the drive home, but I wasn&rsquo;t feeling any pain at this point (thanks to the Valium). My eyes weren&rsquo;t itchy, but I took their advice and downed a Tylenol PM and went to sleep. The 6 hours immediately after are considered the worst, but it&rsquo;s easy to knock yourself out for that period. Your eyes heal best when they are closed, the more sleep you can get, the better off your eyes will be.</p>

<p>6 hours later I woke up and could see pretty darn well. Over the next few hours vision returned more and more to where I was seeing almost as well as with glasses. Things would occasionally go slightly blurry and my eyes would have trouble adapting &ndash; similar to the feel when you wake up in the morning before your eyes focus.</p>

<h2>First Follow-up</h2>

<p>The day after the procedure, they wanted to schedule a follow up to see how things were progressing. This is a really quick followup where they do an old fashion eye test (the big E test) and the doctor asks you a few questions. The day after the procedure my vision was 20/20 in my right eye and 20/25 in my left. According to the doctor it takes a few days for the swelling in your eyes to go down, and in that time your vision will improve. The best thing to do in the meantime is stay on top of your eye drops.</p>

<h2>Adjusting</h2>

<p>For me the hardest part of the entire experience came after the follow up. This is when your eyes are most sensitive to light and your body hasn&rsquo;t yet adjusted to the new vision you&rsquo;re now seeing. After 6 more days when I discontinued the anti-pain/inflammatory drops my eyes went through withdrawal for a night. They were both extremely itchy and all I wanted to do was rub them. By the next day the itching had subsided.</p>

<p>The night visor only needed to be worn for the 6 days after the procedure. This is just to prevent you from rubbing your eyes in your sleep or sleeping on them wrong.</p>

<p>The only side affect for me was that my eyes are now a little dryer than they used to be. Unless I was wearing contacts, I never needed to use eye drops. Lately I have been finding myself using them once or twice a day (at most). The oddest realization was that the feeling of having &ldquo;dry eyes&rdquo; seems to feel different than it did before. It&rsquo;s a tough change to explain, but it&rsquo;s not uncomfortable to the point where eye drops have ever been urgent, or even required.</p>

<p>By the Monday after the surgery I was back at work programming all day without any problems. Twenty days later my vision is up to 20/20 and things are going great! If you&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting LASIK, based on my experience it&rsquo;s a good time to do it. Good luck!</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/backup-like-a-boss/"/>
    <updated>2011-06-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/backup-like-a-boss</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After hearing about the <a href="http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/30"><span class="caps">FBI</span> Raid on Marco Arment&#8217;s servers</a>, it got me interested in how he was doing backups. I&#8217;ve been slowly tweaking my own backup procedures over the last few years &#8212; to the point of being borderline obsessed with having local backups. A few years ago in 2002, a failing <span class="caps">SATA</span> drive containing my windows partition and all my files left me high and dry and without just about any backups of anything. This was a time before <a href="http://db.tt/ueGBRCn">Dropbox</a> and other synchronizing services had come along to make things easier, and I hadn&#8217;t taken the step on my own to make backup a priority.</p>
<p>Two years ago when I was setting up my <a href="http://blog.adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-3-bac/">home media center</a>, I took a first stab at serious backup. Since then I&#8217;ve been gradually tweaking my system and trying new things. What follows is what worked for me.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s being backed up?</h3>
<p>In this case I&#8217;m talking about a lot of data, but split over a few discreet sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Under 60 GB of photos, documents, code and general files.</li>
	<li>About 150 GB of music, mostly ripped from my Mom&#8217;s extensive CD collection when she was a DJ, plus my iTunes downloads.</li>
	<li>About <em>(gulp)</em> 7 TB of movies. This includes a <span class="caps">DVD</span> rip of just every movie I&#8217;ve ever bought.</li>
	<li>3 Macs are being backed up with TimeMachine (Mac Mini and 2 MacBook Pros)</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/mini-small.png" class="right" alt="" /> I eased back to the steam-only version of NetFlix, so this is (luckily) the size of the movies folder no longer going up. Occasionally movies/TV are pruned down, so hopefully that&#8217;ll be down to a &#8220;manageable&#8221; 5TB soon enough.</p>
<h3>What Hardware is this Using?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dedicated Seagate 1TB TimeMachine Hard Drive</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Robotics-FireWire-Storage-DR04DD10/dp/B001CZ9ZEE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1309218669&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=adamfortuna-20">4-bay <span class="caps">USB</span>/Firewire Drobo</a> with 4&#215;2TB drives (~5.6TB) connected to the MacMini</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mediasonic-eSATA-3-5-Inch-Enclosure-HFR2-SU3S2/dp/B003YFHEAC/ref=pd_sim_e_6?tag=adamfortuna-20">4-bay MediaSonic Raid Enclosure</a> with 4&#215;1TB (~3TB) connected to the MacMini</li>
	<li>2 x Western Digital 3TB Drive connected to the Mac Mini (used exclusively for backups).</li>
</ul>
<p class="center"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/drobo.png" alt="" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/mediasonic.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Drobo and MediaSonic both can withstand a single drive failure with no data loss, which is an ideal first line of defense. I&#8217;ve heard from many reviews that the performance of the Drobo is awful, but I haven&#8217;t had too many issues. The initial load of data onto it is a long, slow, painful experience &#8212; and adding a new drive can require upwards of a day before you can use it, but for general use I haven&#8217;t had any issues.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d consider the MediaSonic enclosure as a lower priced alternative. The downside is needing 4 drives up front, but that&#8217;s an issue you&#8217;ll encounter with any <span class="caps">RAID</span> solution. You have the option of choosing the level of Raid you want, and formatting takes only a few minutes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a a year or two since I looked into hardware, but these have both lasted well without any data loss, and without any failed drives (so far).</p>
<h3>Software Makes it Happen</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a few important pieces of software that keep things in sync. In my <a href="http://blog.adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-3-bac/">previous post</a> I was using mostly cron jobs &#8211; which works, but were a little rough around the edges. Since then I&#8217;ve added a few more to the mix: <img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/cronosync.png" class="right" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
	<li>TimeMachine is installed on all 3 Macs</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html">Chronosync</a> installed everywhere</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.backblaze.com/partner/af1782">Backblaze</a> ($50/year) on Mac Mini</li>
	<li><a href="http://db.tt/ueGBRCn">Dropbox</a> ($99/year) on laptop</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if I had less than 100 GB of total data, I&#8217;d just use Dropbox and call it a day. I&#8217;d probably even enable the &#8220;Packrat&#8221; option for unlimited undo history. Even with the recent <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=821">Dropbox authentication bug</a> it&#8217;s still the best tool on the market. There are other ways to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/05/4-ways-to-build-your-own-dropbox.php">roll your own Dropbox</a> that may be worth checking out as well. Dropbox has the added bonus of having an <span class="caps">API</span> that other tools can interact with, that you wouldn&#8217;t get from a home rolled solution.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/screenshots/dropbox_referral.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible to increase the size of your Dropbox with referrals and other promotions they offer. My 50 GB box is up to 67.75 GB at the moment, just by taking advantage of their offer to increase the size with referrals. The additional amount of space for each referral is dependent on your pricing level, so you get more extra space for a referral when you&#8217;re on the 50 GB plan than on the free plan.</p>
<p>Backblaze is a tool I haven&#8217;t heard much fuss about, but for me it&#8217;s been a reliable, cost efficient and effective tool in my backup strategy. The Mac app for Backblaze installs itself into your system preferences and is completely controlled from there. You can specify which folders/drives you want to keep backed up, and tweak the speed to upload.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/screenshots/backblaze_persephone.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It took upwards of 3 months to upload 6 TB to Backblaze (which Brighthouse luckily didn&#8217;t have any issues with). Since then it&#8217;s stayed in sync a few days at any given time. The contents on the drive aren&#8217;t in constant flux, so often it&#8217;s updated within a few minutes. If you&#8217;re on a slow connection, this might not be possible, but <a href="http://brighthouse.com/central-florida/shop/internet/road-runner-lightning">Road Runner Lightning</a> or <span class="caps">FIOS</span> will make the process a lot smoother.</p>
<h3>Bringing it All Together</h3>
<p>The Drobo and Mediasonic devices serve as file storage for archived DVDs, and also store all music I&#8217;ve ever ripped/downloaded. Both devices allow for a single drive failure without the loss of data &#8211; and advantage over the standalone Western Digital 3TB drives which if they fail, all data is lost.</p>
<h4>Time Machine</h4>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/timemachine.png" class="right" alt="" /> The 2 MacBook Pros and the Mac Mini are backed up constantly to Time Machine. Although not encouraged supported, you can plug a <span class="caps">USB</span> hard drive into an Airport Extreme and use it as a TimeMachine drive. From my experience, you can&#8217;t do a first backup via <span class="caps">USB</span> then plug it in there either &#8212; you have to do all backups and restores while it is connected to the Airport Extreme (probably a paths thing).</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Music on my main computer isn&#8217;t backed up to TimeMachine. Usually I have about 100GB of music, podcasts and other videos from iTunes University which is instead backed up to the Mediasonic device. Chronosync does the work of keeping a nightly snapshot of my entire music folder on one of those drives. If I grab a new album off iTunes, or rip a CD, it&#8217;ll be backed up that same day.</p>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/itunes.png" class="left" alt="" /> The MediaSonic has 2 Music folders actually. It has an &#8220;In Use&#8221; folder and an &#8220;Archive&#8221; folder. The MacBook Pro music folder is mirrored to &#8220;In Use&#8221; &#8211; which is always a snapshot of what&#8217;s currently on my laptop. Later, the Mac Mini does a sync to a second &#8220;Archive&#8221; folder. This may sound redundant, but that&#8217;s because for much of the data it is.</p>
<p>The nice part is that if I delete something from my laptop, it&#8217;ll also be deleted from the &#8220;In Use&#8221; copy, but the &#8220;Archive&#8221; folder will retain a copy. The goal of all this is that I can restore my music directly at anytime, not eat up space on the TimeMachine drive, and have an canonical archive for all music.</p>
<h4>In-House Backups</h4>
<p>The MediaSonic drive is synced nightly to one of the WD 3TB drives. The sizes match, so it&#8217;s a clean mirror. Chronosync handles the scheduling and syncing, keeping it easy to edit as well. 3 TB of data from the Drobo is backed up to the other MediaSonic Drive nightly as well. That leaves about 2.6 TB of data that&#8217;s not duplicated in house, but is still available on Backblaze.</p>
<h3>The End Result</h3>
<p>Any single hard drive or device can fail with a backup readily at hand. It&#8217;s important to not only protect against a single hard drive failure but a single device failure. Having a device like a Drobo or a Raid helps with redundancy, but it&#8217;s not a backup &#8212; if the device itself malfunctions or corrupts your data, you&#8217;re out of luck. By having a in house backup of these, I still have access to anything important at a moments notice.</p>
<p>Setting up an offsite backup plan is annoying at first, but once it&#8217;s in place it&#8217;s a huge relief. At the moment I&#8217;m very happy with both Backblaze and Dropbox, and plan to renew both. I haven&#8217;t priced out how much it would cost to store 6 TB on S3, but I imagine it&#8217;d be below $50 a year. The nice part of Backblaze is that they can mail you hard drives loaded with your data in the event of a failure &#8212; or you can just download specific files.</p>
<p>One obvious gap in my setup is offsite backups for my TimeMachine drive. These could be synced up with BackBlaze as well, but at the moment Backblaze requires all backed up drives to be physically connected to the machine with it installed.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s your Plan?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m always interested to see what people are doing to backup large amounts of data like this. If you&#8217;re backing up a large amount of files, or even a small amount, I&#8217;d be interested in hearing what your strategy is!</p>]]></content>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[8 Awesome Uses for DropBox]]></title>
    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/8-awesome-uses-for-dropbox/"/>
    <updated>2009-04-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/8-awesome-uses-for-dropbox</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although only a very small part of my <a href="http://www.adamfortuna.com/2009/03/22/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-3-backup/">backup strategies</a> post dealt with <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0ODEwOQ">Dropbox</a> , after using it for a second week I&#8217;ve fallen for it. Sure, it&#8217;s useful for syncing commonly used files between computers, and there&#8217;s many more files that it would be useful to have revision history on, but there&#8217;s more to it than just sharing files. With that in mind I&#8217;ve been on a rampage to use it for simplifying my life as much as possible. Here&#8217;s a few tricks I&#8217;ve found that help make things easier.</p>
<h3>Backup Folders Not in Dropbox</h3>
<p>Right now Dropbox installs itself into a pre-selected location, then everything in that folder is archived in Dropbox. Syncing outside of the Dropbox folder is on the todo list, but for now there&#8217;s a workaround to do this. Create a symbolic link within the Dropbox folder pointing to the folder you want to archive. For instance, lets say within Dropbox you want your Documents folder. To do this you&#8217;d create a sym link for this.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>ln- s ~/Documents/ ~/Dropbox/Documents</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Dropbox should start syncing right away, and will sync from here on out whenever. Anything that goes into your <code>~/Documents</code> folder will be backed up. One very important thing to note is that if you delete something from the <code>~/Dropbox/Documents</code> folder on another computer, it will be removed from your <code>~/Documents</code> folder on the computer with the symlink, so keep that in mind.</p>
<h3>Syncing Adium Log Files Between Macs</h3>
<p>So you&#8217;re looking through chat logs for a conversation you know you had, but you can&#8217;t seem to find it. Turns out it was on a a different computer. Has this ever happened to you? There&#8217;s a convenient way of syncing Adium log files (or any other log files) with Dropbox. Adium doesn&#8217;t allow you to change your Log directory, but there&#8217;s no reason why you can&#8217;t make the default location a smylink to somewhere else. I have a <code>~/Dropbox/Sync</code> directory where I store any settings/items that I want to keep in Sync between computers, so this is the perfect place for it. I created a <code>~/Dropbox/Sync/chat</code> folder, quit Adium and dragged my existing Adium logs folder into Dropbox (from /Users/adam/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/Default/Logs). All you have to do is point a folder at your Dropbox and you&#8217;re good to go! In my case, the command was:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>ln -s ~/Dropbox/Sync/chat/logs/ &amp;quot;/Users/adam/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Users/Default/Logs&amp;quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Just setup multiple computers with this same path and you should have a single repository for all your chat logs. I&#8217;m not too sure how this works with conflict resolution, but unless you&#8217;re chatting to the same person on multiple computers at the same time you should be good. If you&#8217;ve tried that though, I&#8217;d be interested to see how it works.</p>
<h3>Backup configuration</h3>
<p>This was mentioned earlier, but having a shared space for your backup scripts makes life easier. Dropbox is amazing, but the Dropbox application does have the ability to delete files from your computer. Lets say the worst happens and they delete your account, causing your Dropbox to be deleted on all your computers- &#8211; would you mind? If you have your ~/Documents and other folders linked, this might be a huge blow to lose unless you&#8217;re backing it up somewhere. This same doomsday scenerio could happen if someone hacks into your Dropbox account and removes your files from the web interface. You&#8217;ll probably be able to restore them in that case, but then you&#8217;re relying on Dropbox to fix the Dropbox problem. A more secure way of handling this might be to have a full copy of your Dropbox somewhere locally. With Dropbox maxing out around 55GB, making a full copy of this on some HD you have laying around isn&#8217;t a bad idea. Automating the process and backing up your Dropbox nightly is even better though! So what would something like this look like.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>rsync -rpLtgoDE- -delete ~/Dropbox /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This rsync command will copy everything from my Dropbox to a local directory, in this case on a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a> . This follow all symlinks and copy the contents of them, rather than copying the symlinks themselves. Try saving this one line in a file, <code>backup.command</code> . You should be able to run it by double clicking or from terminal. I store this file in <code>~/Dropbox/Sync/scripts/backup.command</code> so it can be edited from anywhere.</p>
<h3>Version your crontab</h3>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to run that backup script manually everyday do you? To save time (and guarantee a good backup strategy), you&#8217;ll want to have this automatically run. I&#8217;ll recap real quick how to set this up. Just open up terminal on the computer you&#8217;ll be automating the backup. You can call things on a scheduling using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> , which can be opened by entering <code>crontab- e</code> . I&#8217;ve decided to run the above script every day, and backup my list of cron jobs every day.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>@daily crontab -l &amp;gt; ~/Dropbox/Sync/scripts/crontab.txt 30 3 * sh ~/Dropbox/Sync/scripts/backup.command</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The first line will save the crontab contents in the @ ~/Dropbox/Sync/scripts/crontab.txt@ file. The @daily parts means this&#8217;ll happen every night at midnight. The second line is scheduled to run every night at 3:30am as well, but usually takes a little longer. Rsync isn&#8217;t the fastest in the world, but it&#8217;ll get the job done- &#8211; usually in under a minute for me.</p>
<h3>Sync Your <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> Tasks</h3>
<p>For a while during the beta, Things was my <span class="caps">GTD</span>/todo list of choice. The interface has a level of polish that few apps obtain &#8212; and even fewer in the <span class="caps">GTD</span> relm where complexity is the norm. One downside of Things is that it doesn&#8217;t use MobileMe syncing like OmniFocus, it&#8217;s competitor. You can get around this and use your Dropbox for syncing in the same way as Adium though. Just close Things and move your Things database files folder to your Dropbox on one computer &#8212; I threw it in ~/Dropbox/Sync/Things. Create a symlink from where it used to be to the new Dropbox location and you should be good! You&#8217;ll need to do this same step on your other computer(s), but without the copying the file to Dropbox step. This does have a caviat though &#8212; you must close Things each time you switch computers. Unlike Adium, when there&#8217;s a conflict, well it&#8217;s very bad. Your Things database is a single <span class="caps">XML</span> file that cannot be merged. So be sure to always close Things when you switch computers to be safe. If anything goes wrong though, you can always sign into the Dropbox web interface and roll the file back. Or you could just use <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> and not have to worry about syncing.</p>
<h3>Host a Local Wiki</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> is a Wiki unlike any other I&#8217;ve heard of. It has all the storage characteristics of a normal wiki, but exists as a single html file that edits. Just copy it to your Dropbox, open it up in Firefox (you are using FireFox right?) and start making changes. Upon saving it&#8217;ll update the file in Dropbox. As with a few other tips, you probably shouldn&#8217;t have TiddlyWiki open on another when saving. If you&#8217;ve jumped on the TiddlyWiki bandwagon but you&#8217;re using a <span class="caps">USB</span> drive to transfer your Wiki around, Dropbox is a simple upgrade to save some time.</p>
<h3>Sync your Passwords</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t personally use any sort of password manager, but LifeHacker has a good article on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5063176/how-to-use-dropbox-as-the-ultimate-password-syncer">How to Use Dropbox as the Ultimate Password Syncer</a> . According to the Lifehacker article, changes are pulled in right away, even when using multiple computers. This is because 1Password, the password manager used in the article, stores your data in lots of little files, making it ideal for minimal conflicts.</p>
<h3>Sync your Firefox Bookmarks</h3>
<p>Firefox bookmarks are another one that seem like a no-brainer to use Dropbox for. There are so many different bookmark sync services out there that can do this, but why use another service when you&#8217;re already using Dropbox? The basics for this are just copying your firefox profile to Dropbox, then starting Firefox with the- p option which allows you to specify a profile path. Just follow the directions on how to <a href="http://wiki.getdropbox.com/TipsAndTricks/SyncFirefoxBookmarks">Sync Firefox Bookmarks</a> from the Dropbox Wiki and you should be good. This tip doesn&#8217;t use symlinks like a number of others, making it a little easier to setup.</p>
<h3>Join Dropbox</h3>
<p>Dropbox provides 2gb of storage out of the gate, but if you signup with a <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0ODEwOQ">referral link</a> , you&#8217;ll get an extra 250mb of space (and I&#8217;ll get an extra 250mb too)! The desktop app works on Mac, PC and Linux with a very simple install on all of them. If you join up and have any other tips or tricks, feel free to share them here!</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-3-bac/"/>
    <updated>2009-03-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-3-bac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Describing what I&#8217;ve been working on so far as a media center may not be quite sufficient. Now a days term &#8220;home server&#8221; seems to do it a bit more justice, and if a home computer is on full time you&#8217;ll certainly want to get the most out of it. If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to do backups within your home, you might&#8217;ve looked into <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx">Windows Home Server</a> or Apples <a href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/">Time Capsule</a> / <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">Time Machine</a> setups, but neither is quite what I was looking for. First off, I don&#8217;t really want a Windows box in (mostly) mac home, so that&#8217;s out. Time Machine alone doesn&#8217;t do everything I have in mind, although it does play an important part. I&#8217;ve had a lot of backup plans in the past, but none were quite &#8220;perfect&#8221;, which got me wondering what a perfect backup plan would look like.</p>
<h3>What do you want in backup plan?</h3>
<p>Just like in creating software, when setting up a backup plan it&#8217;s important to know your requirements ahead of time. Otherwise what are you working towards? So what do I want this backup plan to be able to do&#8230;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make it so that there is no single point of failure for any important data</li>
	<li>Have on site and off site backups of everything</li>
	<li>Backup and sync core data between macs (settings, address book, calendar, keychain, etc)</li>
	<li>Some kind revision system for all text files. Something like git or svn where you can rollback changes</li>
	<li>A local redundant hard drive array to guarantee no data loss if a single drive fails</li>
	<li>Backup all core documents on various time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly). That way if I mess up a file and don&#8217;t realize it for a week I&#8217;ll be able to grab the version a month ago.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Settings, Calendars, Address Book and more</h3>
<p>If you have multiple Macs <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">Mobile Me</a> is a good choice for easy syncing between macs. The system has had a lot of problems, and continues to struggle with performance. iDisk, the webdav interface to your MobileMe account is <em>painfully</em> slow, and continues to be. Just cleaning out a few hundred empty folders was enough to stall it earlier. The online image gallery MobileMe has is one of the better one&#8217;s seen, and if you use iPhoto it&#8217;s a convenient photo storage location. Just so that all my calendars and contacts aren&#8217;t confined to a single system (the Mac ecosystem), I use <a href="http://spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync</a> to keep my Google Calendars and Google Contacts in check with iCal and Address Book. My girlfriend and I share calendars with each other on Google, and this way any changes she makes show up on my iCal, and any I make on iCal show up on hers. Also, whenever I get Google Calendar invites to my email address, they show up on Google Calendar then get syncd back to iCal. 2 way syncing is the way to go!</p>
<h3>Complete Backups With Time Machine</h3>
<p>Time Capsule is powerful and dead simple for full system backups. The way it works is simple: all macs on a network will have Time Machine (a program that ships with Leopard) enabled and set to use the Time Capsule hardware. Every hour or so, changes made to the core and specific folders will be pushed from the client computer (in this case my laptop) to the Time Capsule. You can specify which folders to watch for this as well. You might not want it watching your Downloads folder or others that are similarly volatile, but that&#8217;s easy to change. The first time you back up everything to Time Capsule you&#8217;ll want a hardline to it rather than doing it over a home network (even if it&#8217;s wireless N). Transferring your entire computer initially could take a full day if not, so be sure to plug it in. The hourly backups after that work wirelessly though, as they are much much smaller. Apple&#8217;s Airport Extreme has the ability to add a remote hard drive which can serve as a Time Machine drive as well. The nice part about this is that you can use an old external hard drive you have, or choose any drive out there. Leopard didn&#8217;t originally allow you to sync with drives like this, but in one of the recent updates it was enabled. For me, after the initial backup the incremental backups are very quick if not much has changed. Running TimeMachine for the first time is a trippy experience. You &#8220;go back in time&#8221; to the point where you want to see a file, then you can restore it. This covers a few of the requirements such as versioned files locally and full system backups with the ability to restore on any Mac.</p>
<h3>Backups to a local <span class="caps">RAID</span> (or Drobo)</h3>
<p>Finally, the first step that the Media Center can help with. Whether you go with <span class="caps">RAID</span>, a <a href="http://www.drobo.com/">Drobo</a> or something else, the backup procedure to it will be about the same. The easiest way I&#8217;ve found to do backups to this is with rsync and crontab. Here&#8217;s how it works: Your media server will have a series of scripts setup to run daily, weekly and monthly. These scripts will do all the heavy lifting of the backup &#8211; grabbing files from every computer on your network you want to backup and moving them to the redundant array. So firstoff the media server should be setup to backup everything from the computers on the network. That&#8217;s easy actually. On each computer you want to back files up from, go into System Preferences &gt; Sharing and enable &#8220;Remote Login&#8221;. This will allow the media center to ssh into each laptop. Backing up using rsync can be done by mapping drives in Finder and using those paths (/Volumes/adam), or by using <span class="caps">SSH</span>. With <span class="caps">SSH</span> you don&#8217;t have to map the drive beforehand, so it is the preferred method. On the media center, open up a text file. This will contain everything you want to copy from your client computers, and the path (on your media center) that you want to store them in.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>rsync -aE --delete adam@link.local:Desktop /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current
<p>rsync -aE &#8212;delete adam@link.local:Documents /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete adam@link.local:Movies /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete adam@link.local:Pictures /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete adam@link.local:Processing /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete adam@link.local:Sites /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>Note that the destination (the 2nd path) is the same. That&#8217;s just because it&#8217;ll actually store the documents folder in &#8220;/Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Documents&#8221;. The- a option specifies &#8220;Archive&#8221;, which is actually shorthand for a few other options. It will recusively copy all directories, copy symlinks, preserve file permissions, preserve owner and groups, preserve file times preserve special files. The &#45;E flag preserves executability, while &#45;&#45;delete deletes extraneous files &#45; like those that were deleted. Save this file somewhere on the media center as a .command file. I kept it simple &#8211; backup.command. You should be able to run this script by just double clicking on it now. But there is a one major problem &#8212; authentication.</p>
<h3>Setting up <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys</h3>
<p>By setting up <span class="caps">SSH</span> Keys you can automate the authentication from the Media Server to any clients you want to backup. The way you do this is very easy. On the Media server, run the command @ ssh-keygen- t dsa@ . Go with the defaults, but choose a passphrase you can remember. Copy this file from the Media server to the computer you want to backup <span class="caps">FROM</span>. Since you should already have <span class="caps">SSH</span> setup, something like this should do the job.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>link:~ adam$ scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub adam@link.local:~/.ssh/authorized_keys2@</code></pre>
</div>
<p>If you already have an <code>authorized_keys2</code> file, you&#8217;ll want to add the contents of <code>id_dsa.pub</code> to it instead of replacing it. After that&#8217;s updated, try SSHing to that client from the Media Server. You should get prompted for the passphrase (a mac prompt, not a terminal prompt). After you enter it and save it for later you should be able to <span class="caps">SSH</span> without any password going forward.</p>
<h3>Setting it up to run automatically</h3>
<p>Not worrying about backups is the whole point of this entire system, so running it automatically is essential. Luckily Unix systems have an easy way of doing this using cron jobs. To open up the list of cron jobs, just enter <code>crontab -e</code> in a terminal window. This will open up the cron file using VI. Editing in VI can be a bit annoying without knowing the comamnds. To edit it you don&#8217;t need to know much VI though. Just hit &#8220;i&#8221; to go into insert mode, where you can start typing. Each line you enter is a single scheduled cron job with a very specific format. For example, here&#8217;s a line to run a script every day at 3:30am:</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>30 3 * sh ~/Dropbox/scripts/backup.command</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The &#8220;30 3 *&#8221; part deals with when it should be run, while the part after that is what to run. Here&#8217;s what those first 5 options translate to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>30- minute to run job on</li>
	<li>3 &#8211; hour to run job on</li>
	<li>* &#8211; Day of the month to run job on</li>
	<li>* &#8211; Which month to run job on</li>
	<li>* &#8211; Which day of the week to run the job on</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit tricky to remember at first, but it&#8217;s a very simple scheduling system. For example, if you want to run something on sunday (the 0th day of the week) at 5:30 am, the parameters would be &#8220;30 5 0 &#8230;&#8221;. Here&#8217;s my full crontab that I&#8217;m using (some of these scripts I haven&#8217;t discussed yet, but we&#8217;ll get to later).</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>30 3 * sh ~/Dropbox/scripts/backup.command
<p>00 5 1 sh ~/Dropbox/scripts/weekly.command <br />
00 6 1 sh ~/Dropbox/scripts/monthly.command <br />
30 6 1 sh ~/Dropbox/scripts/external.backup.command</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>The weekly and monthly scripts will just take a snapshot every month rather than every day. Nothing much to those scripts &#8212; just removing the last update and copying a snapshot. The monthly script is exactly the same but with &#8220;weekly&#8221; changed to &#8220;monthly&#8221;. The point of this is that if anything big goes wrong, you&#8217;ll have a backup locally of the original.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>rm -rf /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/weekly/ cp- pR /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/ /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/weekly/</code></pre>
</div>
<h3>Versioned changes with Dropbox</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0ODEwOQ">DropBox</a> is probably my favorite part of all this. After signing up for DropBox, you install a small program on each computer you want to use it with. It&#8217;ll create a DropBox folder at a location you pick (I went with the default ~/Dropbox). Anything you add to this folder will get synced up to the Dropbox service. What&#8217;s extra-useful about this is that all files will be versioned. I&#8217;m storing my Documents and Sites folders in here and backing up daily. Even if I haven&#8217;t committed site changes for something I&#8217;m working on, it&#8217;ll still have a daily revision of changes. I have a few other commands in my backup.command file that copy things over to a DropBox folder on the Media Server.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>rsync -aE --delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Documents ~/Dropbox
<p>rsync- aE &#8212;delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Sites ~/Dropbox</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>One really nice part about Dropbox&#8217;s desktop client is that you can limit the upload speed. With RoadRunner my upstream is capped to about 70k/s when it&#8217;s in a good mood, and maxing it out will usually slow down any downloads. Being able to cap it to 10k/s is very useful in my situation.</p>
<h3>Backing up your backup scripts</h3>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that my backup scripts where in my Dropbox: <code>~/Dropbox/scripts/backup.command</code> . Not only does this mean that you&#8217;ve backed up your scripts (always a good practice), but you can change your backup procedure from anywhere you can access Dropbox! This is so simple it&#8217;s one of the most effortless things to setup. You can also copy the contents of your crontab file Add this line to your crontab: <code>@daily crontab- l &gt; ~/Dropbox/crontab.txt</code> &#8220;@daily&#8221; is shorthand for &#8220;everyday at midnight&#8221;. This is a nice way of archiving any changes you make to your crontab. With the other backup scripts you can make changes on any computer and the Media Center will pull them in thanks to DropBox. But for the crontab you&#8217;ll actually want to make changes directly to the Media Center using the &#8220;crontab -e&#8221; command.</p>
<h3>External backups of everything else</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0ODEwOQ">DropBox</a> is free up to 2GB making it excellent for documents, but not very realistic for media. They do offer a plan up to 50GB for $99/yr, which blows MobileMe&#8217;s 20GB plan out of the water. Most the use I get from MobileMe is in syncing computers though, so I&#8217;ll keep it going for that. For now I&#8217;ll stick with MobileMe for my larger media backup as well, although I can tell you now I&#8217;m not exactly happy about it. One of the downsides of MobileMe is that it doesn&#8217;t automatically mount itself on startup. Normally you have to click on it in Finder to mount the drive. Only then it&#8217;ll show in &#8220;/Volumes&#8221;. You can open up Script Editor and create a small app to do this though. Just copy this and change it to use your username and password. @ tell application &#8220;Finder&#8221; mount volume &#8220;http://idisk.mac.com/myusername/&#8221; as user name &#8220;myusername&#8221; with password &#8220;mypassword&#8221; end tell @ Save it as file format &#8220;Application&#8221; with &#8220;Run Only&#8221; checked, but don&#8217;t check &#8220;Stay Open&#8221; or &#8220;Startup Screen&#8221;. Save this application somewhere then add it to your startup items. The last part is setting up the &#8220;remote.command&#8221; script listed earlier. This will do all the work of copying everything remotely, with the exception of whatever uses Dropbox.</p>
<div>
<pre><code class='bash'>rsync -aE --delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Documents /Volumes/myusername
<p>rsync -aE &#8212;delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Backup /Volumes/myusername <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Desktop /Volumes/myusername/Documents <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Movies /Volumes/myusername <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Pictures /Volumes/myusername <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete /Volumes/Drobo/Users/adam/current/Sites /Volumes/myusername <br />
rsync -aE &#8212;delete /Volumes/Drobo/Books /Volumes/myusername/Documents</code></pre></p>
</div>
<p>This just runs weekly everything here doesn&#8217;t change that much. The Pictures directly is the main one that&#8217;ll be updated, as it&#8217;s a single iPhoto file that changes often.</p>
<h3>Woh, that&#8217;s a lot. Did we miss anything?</h3>
<p>Well, two things were skipped- &#8211; Music and Videos. I have a decent sized music collection, and I tend to archive my DVDs for use with Plex. Backing up 2TB of data remotely when you&#8217;re limited to 70k/s upload speeds isn&#8217;t exactly possible. What I am doing is storing all my media on a Drobo which protects it against a single hard drive failure (maybe more, depending on when the failures occur). My TimeMachine drive is actually a 500gb drive split &#8211; 200 for Time Machine and the rest for media backup. Every night the Media Center pushes all music from the Drobo onto this external drive. At least that way all my music is protected in case the Drobo itself fails. There&#8217;s no external backup for music, but I&#8217;m OK with that. If I was a little more paranoid I might archive weekly and leave the drive at work or something, but that&#8217;s where I draw the line. That leaves one gaping hole &#8211; the movie collection this system was for in the first place! For now I&#8217;m content with being protected against a single HD failure with the Drobo, but if anyone has any suggestions on how to back this up I&#8217;m all ears. Also if you think of anything else I missed, or just something I could do better then please leave a comment!</p>
<h3>Did this help?</h3>
<p>If this article helped you, please sign up for <a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTY0ODEwOQ">DropBox</a> ! DropBox was in beta for a while, but now it&#8217;s open and anyone can sign up. You get 2GB of space just for signing up. They have the added bonus of increasing your space by 250mb for everyone you refer (up to 5GB total), so by signing up you&#8217;ll give me more space to experiment with. It&#8217;s easily the best backup service I&#8217;ve used, so I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing how it grows.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-2-ple/"/>
    <updated>2009-03-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-2-ple</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If there&#8217;s a killer app out there in the media center world, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/">Plex</a> . Built on the long running <a href="http://xbmc.org/"><span class="caps">XBMC</span></a> , Plex is a fork of the project optimized to run on the Mac. <span class="caps">XBMC</span> has been around since the first Xbox, making one of the most established media center platforms out there. It&#8217;s long outgrown the console however, and now serves as the core for projects like Plex and <a href="http://boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> . It was also featured on a recent <a href="http://twit.tv/FLOSS"><span class="caps">FLOSS</span> Weekly</a> episode which is worth a listen. With lots of <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/2009/03/09/review-boxee-media-center-or-going-hd-part-4">recent talk about Boxee</a> , I thought I&#8217;d add Plex to the conversation with a little talk on why I think it&#8217;s the best media center software available.</p>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/home.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>Media Management</h3>
<p>Like other projects based on <span class="caps">XBMC</span>, Plex has built in capacity for managing your media collection. This enables Plex to have an internal listing of what movies you have available in a much nicer format than the typical folder structure. Within Plex you do this by adding sources (in the form of folders containing files) and specifying what type of content resides there (movies, tv shows, music videos). Plex even allows for different sources to pull down the information on the video- &#8211; from <span class="caps">IMDB</span>, <span class="caps">OFDB</span>, MovieMaze, TheTVDB, TV.com and many more. If you want to pull data from another site, it can be added using Python, so if a better movie database comes out, it&#8217;s just a matter of writing an adapter for it. Plex uses the file name or folder name to look it up, so it&#8217;s important to name your files correctly and add the year the movie/tv show was released. You can do this manually from within Plex as well, but it&#8217;ll find your media on <span class="caps">IMDB</span> if your files are named correctly.</p>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/movies_list.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>One issue that always come up when crawling a media collection is varying file format and folder structure. Chances are not all of your videos will be in the same format. Some might be single file avis, mkvs, or they might be in multiple small files (disc1, disc2), or even in <span class="caps">DVD</span> rips (in a VIDEO_TS folder) or Blu-ray rips. If you follow Plex&#8217;s conventions, all of these can be used and you won&#8217;t even have to concern yourself with it later on. Here&#8217;s a sample folder structure for this setup: @/<span class="caps">WALL</span>.E (2008).mkv /Wanted (2008)/any_file_name_disca.avi /Wanted (2008)/any_file_name_discb.avi /Waltz with Bashir (2008)/VIDEO_TS/* (<span class="caps">DVD</span> contents here) @ To Plex all these will be listed the same, with <span class="caps">IMDB</span> show descriptions, artwork, genre listing and even actor/actresses if you want. When you play &#8220;Wanted (2008)&#8221;, it&#8217;ll queue up all files in the folder and play them in alphabetical order. I sometimes notice a short skip when it transitions to the second video, but it may not be noticeable all the time. Playing the <span class="caps">DVD</span> file is very similar as well. Upon selecting it to play, it&#8217;ll open you up to the <span class="caps">DVD</span> title menu, the same menu you&#8217;d go to if you were using the <span class="caps">DVD</span> itself! I&#8217;ve found there is a bit more overhead to using DVDs, as it has to put the entire menu into memory, rather than streaming the video from the start. This is really only an issue if you&#8217;re playing your media off a <span class="caps">NAS</span>. DVDs will still work, but they won&#8217;t be as snappy at starting.</p>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/single_episode.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>TV shows are categorized by season number, but aside from that they work the same. Each season has it&#8217;s own folder, and within that each episode is named accordingly. You can choose to add in descriptions, or leave them blank. You can also combine episodes if multiple ones are in the same file. @/Arrested Development (2003)/Season 1/Arrested Development (2003)- S01E01 &#8211; pilot.avi /Arrested Development (2003)/Season 1/Arrested Development (2003) &#8211; S01E02.avi /Arrested Development (2003)/Season 1/Arrested Development (2003) &#8211; S01E03-04.avi @ Like with movies, TV DVDs also work here, but you&#8217;d want to check the <a href="http://wiki.plexapp.com/">Plex Wiki</a> for instructions on setting that up. In addition to downloading cast, banners and artwork from movies and TV shows, Plex will also download TV theme songs. As you&#8217;re browsing through your TV shows you&#8217;ll hear a little snippet that Plex was able to grab for each series. One very relivieving thing to note is that Plex won&#8217;t touch your media folders or add new files to them at all. You know how you can set iTunes to manage your media library? There&#8217;s no similar setting on Plex. You have full control of your files, and Plex won&#8217;t alter them in any way. The additional files that Plex downloads will be stored your Application Support folder on the computer running Plex.</p>
<h3>Library Searching</h3>
<p>After all you files have been discovered by Plex that&#8217;s when the fun begins. Just browsing your movies and tv shows is a visual treat, and the Plex team has done an excellent job of making the experience similar regardless of what type of artwork is available. You can filter Movies or TV shows by year, imdb rating, director, genre, actor/actress, and even whether or not you&#8217;ve seen them or not. The ability to list what you haven&#8217;t seen, and even hide descriptions for new items, is extremely useful, serving as a bookmark for where you left off in a series. The Favorites system that was recently introduced gives one click access to some commonly used movies, shows or even apps. I&#8217;m currently re-watching a TV Series, so having in Favorites saves time. If you&#8217;re using a Harmony Remote, you can even setup a button to open favorite directly. For instance, if you wanted to watch something with Christian Bale in it, you could filter your entire movie library to just movies he was in. Plex keeps an internal actor/actress list if you specify it when adding a folder (a source).</p>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/media_center/show_movie.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3>3rd Party Plugins</h3>
<p>With a little background in Python, anyone can create plugins to pull video from other sites. Since this feature was added to the .7 release of Plex a few months ago, there&#8217;s been a huge flood of these apps making Plex better and better. Some of the more popular include Hulu, Joost, <span class="caps">MTV</span>, Comedy Central, South Park, Ted, Escapist Magazine (Zero Punctuation!), Youtube, Apple Trailers, Pandora, <span class="caps">CNN</span>, The Onion, Daily Show, Colbert Report- &#8211; the list goes on and on. The framework for building these apps allows full screen playback and scaling of flash videos, which just about all of these are. Need to click on a close button within the video so an ad doesn&#8217;t show? The plugin developer can even do that. These plugins have quickly become one of the most useful features in Plex for expanding it into new territory.</p>
<h3>External Applications</h3>
<p>You can setup any application to launch from within Plex. When this application is closed, Plex is reopened. This seems like a throwaway feature at first glance &#8212; why would you need to open up something else when Plex can do so much? But from a media center standpoint it helps having one more way of extending the livingroom feel without having to go back to the mouse/keyboard setup if you get it right. One application that is a prime candidate for launching in this manner is <a href="http://www.emulaunch.com/">Emulaunch</a> , and emulator launching program. Emulaunch fits in perfectly &#8212; running full screen and launching ROMs full screen. Emulaunch isn&#8217;t an actual emulator program, for that you&#8217;ll need something like <a href="http://www.snes9x.com/">SNES9x</a> . Emulaunch will run the rom using whatever program it&#8217;s associated to run in (whatever program would run it when you double click). Without much trouble at all I was playing some Zelda a Link to the Past launched from Plex. If you were playing a specific game repeatedly, you could also set it up to run directly from Plex by launching the emulator you&#8217;d want to use and passing the game in as an argument. Since it&#8217;s possible to use Xbox 360 controllers (both wired, or wireless if you buy the controller adapter), this could easily become a new center for gaming.</p>
<h3>Remote Control</h3>
<p>I mentioned this last week, but it bears repeating &#8212; Plex has excellent support for apple remotes and Harmony remotes. I&#8217;d been using an Apple remote for the past year without any trouble actually. It&#8217;s so simple to use that you could give it to someone who&#8217;s never used Plex before and they&#8217;d be able to navigate around, play videos and even browse Hulu. To be fair, you can do all this with an Apple remote from Boxee as well. One of the advantages of Plex though, is that by holding down the menu button, you can get a list of advanced features which become important in managing a media collection. You could be perfectly happy running Plex with an Apple remote for a long time. I still plan to use it when people are over because of how easily new people take to it. For general use though, I love having a universal remote &#8212; a single remote for all my devices. That&#8217;s where the Harmony One comes in. With the One, and other higher end Harmony remotes, you set all devices through the bundled software. I was shocked when I went to add my Mac Mini here only to find Plex as a listed device. This sets up the remote with all of Plex&#8217;s default keys, getting your running with Plex right away. There is also a screen from within Plex to set this up which can be set for the Harmony line of remotes.</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-1-har/"/>
    <updated>2009-03-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/building-the-ultimate-media-center-part-1-har</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a geek, chances are you&#8217;ve dreamed of having an amazing media setup that gives you a movie theater at home feel while providing all the options to extend it with your media. Well, thanks to the recent release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Apple Mac mini</a> , hardware and software (specifically <a href="http://www.plexapp.com">Plex</a> ) are at a great point right now to do just about everything you could want on a single system. Since this past Tuesday when the Mac Mini came out I&#8217;ve been setting a system for this purpose. Hopefully my research can save someone else a little bit of time.</p>
<h3>So what do I want to be able to do?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Watch TV</li>
	<li>Watch DVDs/BluRay</li>
	<li>Watch downloaded/ripped videos of any format (avi, mkv, DVDs, hd video)</li>
	<li>Stream videos off the network (so we don&#8217;t have to have a <span class="caps">NAS</span> in the living room)</li>
	<li>Have some sort of way to track ratings, seen/not seen, imdb information, genres, cast, and movie/tv show information automatically</li>
	<li>Ability to watch 1080p video with minimal artifacts (if any)</li>
	<li>Play video games through an emulator</li>
	<li>Use a wireless Xbox 360 controller for games</li>
	<li>Use a single remote control for media center, dvd, blueray, cable</li>
	<li>Full surround sound (7.1, or 5.1 at least)</li>
	<li>Watch videos from a variety of web-only sources ( <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu</a> , <a href="http://www.joost.com">Joost</a> , <a href="http://www.ted.com"><span class="caps">TED</span></a> , others)</li>
</ul>
<p>All these things and more will be possible through this system, though it will take some setting up and experimentation.</p>
<h3>Uhh, what don&#8217;t you want to do?</h3>
<p>This is just as important to know when it can impact the core hardware. There is one thing left out of here- the ability to record from cable on a computer (a <span class="caps">DVR</span>). This is one feature that has always sounded cool in theory. <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> looks impressive, but the idea of having something I setup control whether I see my favorite shows or not is one big variable. The hardware encoding and conversion don&#8217;t interest me too much at this point, and since I don&#8217;t plan on archiving media indefinitely, there&#8217;s no need for digital copy. Likewise for the ability to watch TV through a media center. I have a <span class="caps">DVR</span> setup anyway, so I don&#8217;t mind switching from the media center over to it for TV. Someday maybe these could be one &#8212; someday soon actually.</p>
<h3>Hardware Matters</h3>
<p>This system will be running <a href="http://www.plexapp.com/">Plex</a> at it&#8217;s core, so it will have to be a Mac. Since it&#8217;ll be in the living room, and because we&#8217;re aiming for lowest power consumption the Mini is the perfect choice. Like all Macs it also has Bluetooth and IR capabilities so we can go completely wireless. Some of the other hardware will be completely dependent on what you want as the core of your system.</p>
<h3>Generic Hardware</h3>
<p>The TV, Cable Box/<span class="caps">DVR</span> Box and Receiver could really be anything for this. There are a couple of requirements, but nothing that even middle of the line items don&#8217;t have anymore. The TV should have at least one <span class="caps">HDMI</span> input, and doesn&#8217;t hurt to have a Component IN. The receiver should also have inputs for at least your cable box and a <span class="caps">HDMI</span> connector. It should also have at least two optical audio (toslink) connections. The receiver should also have 5.1 surround (2 front, 1 center, 2 side speakers), or 7.1 surround (5.1 + 2 behind). 6.1 Surround will also work (5.1 + 1 behind). Hopefully your cable box will have component or <span class="caps">HDMI</span> output as well as toslink for audio for full surround and HD video. The speakers and speaker cable can be whatever; there are better places than here for information on that.</p>
<h3>Media Computer</h3>
<p>Ah yes, this is the core of this new system isn&#8217;t it. This should be one of the new Mac Mini&#8217;s for a few major reasons. The <span class="caps">CPU</span> is slightly faster 2.0/2.26Ghz rather than 1.83Ghz. It also has a faster frontside bus. The graphics card is wildly improved from 64mb to 128/256mb. Old models only had 1GB of memory and it was not officially expandable. Now though, models start at 1GB/2GB and go up to 4GB (through 2&#215;2GB chips). That difference in the graphics card looks like it would make a world of difference when playing videos, but it&#8217;s just not the case. There is no hardware assisted decoding when playing media files so video ram doesn&#8217;t help out one bit. <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148191&amp;amp;nm_mc=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r&amp;amp;cm_mmc=OTC-pr1c3grabb3r-_-Memory+(Notebook+Memory)-_-Crucial+Technology-_-20148191">Adding more <span class="caps">RAM</span></a> is what makes all the difference actually. Maxing it out at 4GB is only an extra $50, so it&#8217;s well worth it. Plex does an amazing job of rendering videos that no other video software can play, but it requires some serious <span class="caps">RAM</span> to make it happen.</p>
<h3>Audio</h3>
<p>Only a few cables are needed to get things going. To output sound you&#8217;ll need a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=mozilla-20&amp;amp;index=blended&amp;amp;link_code=qs&amp;amp;field-keywords=toslink">toslink cable</a> as well as a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Toslink-Female-Mini-Plug-Male-Adapter/dp/B000FMM8TO/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1236569536&amp;amp;sr=8-17">mini to toslink adapter</a> . The mini uses special combination analog/optical-digital audio jacks, so with toslink cables you can get full surround sound.</p>
<h3>Video</h3>
<p>The Mini has a mini-<span class="caps">DVI</span> port and comes with a mini-<span class="caps">DVI</span> to <span class="caps">DVI</span>-D connector, which is what we&#8217;ll use for video. Your TV might have a <span class="caps">DVI</span> input, but the quality won&#8217;t be the same as using <span class="caps">HDMI</span>. I found that my TV wouldn&#8217;t go to full 1080p with the <span class="caps">DVI</span> connector attached, but with <span class="caps">HDMI</span> it would. Luckily there&#8217;s plenty of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_e?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;amp;field-keywords=hdmi+to+dvi&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"><span class="caps">DVI</span>-D to <span class="caps">HDMI</span></a> cables on Amazon. You shouldn&#8217;t buy <span class="caps">HDMI</span> cables locally at all actually. Best Buy sells them for 10x the price on Amazon (or more).</p>
<h3>Computer Devices</h3>
<p>I already had a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MB167LL-A-Wireless-Keyboard/dp/B000V01RLK/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1236570418&amp;amp;sr=1-8">Apple wireless keyboard</a> and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mighty-Mouse-Wireless-Kit/dp/B000V1LOC6/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1236570418&amp;amp;sr=1-9">wireless Might Mouse</a> , which do the trick. There&#8217;s no way I want cables running from my media center all the way to the couch each time I need to use it, so wireless is essential- &#8211; as are rechargeable batteries. The mini found both of these devices when it was first started, which was an added bonus.</p>
<h3>Gaming Devices</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Controller/dp/B000B6MLUA/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=videogames&amp;amp;qid=1236570794&amp;amp;sr=8-1">Xbox 360 Controller</a> is absolutely amazing. It feels more natural in your hands than any other controller, has a great combination of controls that allow it work with just about any previous system. Keeping with the previous trend, we also want this to be wireless. Using a wireless controller should be a breeze these days, but Microsoft decided to use a proprietary RF format so no one else could use it. Well, not without some hoops anyways. If you have a <span class="caps">USB</span> Xbox 360 controller it should work once you&#8217;ve setup some drivers for it. To use the wireless controller though, you also have to buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Receiver-Windows-Pc/dp/B000HZFCT2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;qid=1236571475&amp;amp;sr=1-1">Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver for Windows</a> . This is a little <span class="caps">USB</span> device that allows you to pair your controllers with a computer. By default it doesn&#8217;t work on the Mac, although thanks to <a href="http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver">the great work</a> by some smart people, the controller works great. The driver adds a preference pane where you can test out if the controllers are working too, which is great for testing too.</p>
<h3>Remote Control</h3>
<p>Plex has amazing support for the Apple Remote. Although the Mac Mini doesn&#8217;t come with it, it&#8217;s a perfectly good remote for controlling just about anything within Plex. It doesn&#8217;t control the TV or receiver though, you&#8217;d still need multiple remote controls. That&#8217;s where a great remote like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Harmony-Advanced-Universal-Remote/dp/B00119T6NQ">Logitech Harmony One</a> comes into play. In addition to working on all my devices (and just about anything out there), it comes with a special setting in for Plex! The One also has a series of macro buttons you can use to do multiple things at once. For instance, using Plex requires changing my TV to the <span class="caps">HDMI</span> input and changing the receiver to the PC input. Doing this and going back to Cable is a one click process. There&#8217;s a few more bells and whistles you can customize for Harmony within Plex as well, once you&#8217;re up and running. For instance, you can add one touch buttons for things like &#8220;Watch Hulu&#8221;, or &#8220;My Favorites&#8221; or even &#8220;Watch The Daily Show on Hulu&#8221;. Not bad for a single click. You can also customize the buttons per context as well. So the number 0 might do something different when you&#8217;re watching a movie than when you&#8217;re in a listing of movies. Lots of possibilities there.</p>
<h3>That&#8217;s all there is to it</h3>
<p>Getting everything up and running was surprisingly smooth. It&#8217;s all dependent on a very small set of core programs and some smart settings to keep memory usage low. If you&#8217;re wanting to see if your setup can handle HD video, try downloading the <a href="http://forums.plexapp.com/index.php?showtopic=3029">birds scene from Planet Earth</a> and see how it performs. If it doesn&#8217;t even run (and chances are it might not), try downloading Plex and trying it form there. You can also benchmark within Plex by pressing &#8216;i&#8217;, which can serve as a good gauge of how many frames are being dropped. I&#8217;ll save that for the next entry on media software.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/your-office-fun-or-functional/"/>
    <updated>2008-07-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/your-office-fun-or-functional</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever seen pictures of the crazy work environments at <a href="http://www.officesnapshots.com/category/pixar/">Pixar</a> or <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/01/inside-google-office-videos-and.html">Google</a> you&#8217;ll notice that most offices/cubes are cluttered, but people obviously get a lot done there. Well, <span class="caps">IZEA</span> decided it was time to bring a little of that creative clutter into the office and is having it&#8217;s own cube design content- &#8211; <a href="http://community.izea.com/blog/2008/07/izeas-cubico--1.html">Cubico Loco!</a> . The contest brought in many more themes than I would&#8217;ve guessed including a video games cube, a stripper pole and a champagne room (complete with condom dispenser).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no shortage of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/payperpost/sets/72157605942033426/">pictures</a> thanks to the camera-fiends at <span class="caps">IZEA</span>. When it comes to creating a workspace though, would you want something fun (themed, cube toys, colorful) or would you favor a workspace that&#8217;s purely functional? I decided to go with a fun but functional setup for my workspace, putting up something that could stay up year round. The theme? <a href="http://flyingspaghettimonster.com/">Flying Spaghetti Monster!</a> Marilyn and I were able to create a little <span class="caps">FSM</span> plushie, along with a blowup of the famous <a href="http://www.venganza.org/images/wallpapers/noodlycreation.jpg">noodly creation</a> drawing. There are a few bits of pirate memorabilia, some random pasta, <span class="caps">FSM</span> stickers and such, and of course the gospel sitting high.</p>
<p class="center"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/office/fsm.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Of course this goes against my <a href="http://www.adamfortuna.com/2008/02/03/new-office-setup/">home office setup</a> . It&#8217;s the very definition of a functional office. It makes a more sense to have that kind of setup at home to me, while keeping the office space more fun. If your work is lacking some decorations, I&#8217;d definitely suggest holding a similar contest. I also like the idea of a <a href="http://community.izea.com/blog/2008/07/izeas-cubico--1.html">public vote for the winner</a> , which will be factored in with interoffice votes for the winner. Please vote! It doesn&#8217;t have to be mine of course, but more votes can&#8217;t hurt. There&#8217;s plenty of great cubes better and more deserving than one worshiping and parody deity of a religion. :)</p>]]></content>

    <updated>2006-12-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/one-more-new-member-of-9rules</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago I was infatuated with Ruby on Rails, the Prototype Javascript library and just about any other cool css/js hot topics. I was reading everything I could get my hands on that was in the beginner to intermediate range. There was only one Rails book out at that time, Agile Development with Rails, and almost no Prototype support (well, there&#8217;s still not too much for Prototype unfortunately). The biggest help at that time were blogs like <a href="http://encytemedia.com/">Encytemedia</a> , <a href="http://particletree.com/">ParticleTree</a> , <a href="http://blog.nanorails.com/">nano <span class="caps">RAILS</span></a> and <a href="http://orderedlist.com/">Ordered List</a> . Up until around this time, I hadn&#8217;t started reading blogs outside of my friends list at Livejournal, but <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> changed that! So throughout all these great sites I noticed the trend of 9Rules affiliation, and although I didn&#8217;t dig into what it was at the time, it stuck with me. That was until one of these guys mentioned that 9Rules was allowing new submissions back in October. Now, throughout all the time when I was digging into the Rails community, I never saw much notice of Coldfusion. The 9 rules community, as well as a lot of the programming community just doesn&#8217;t see the many many Coldfusion bloggers that are out there. Doing a search on 9 Rules for Coldfusion, the only post that came up was one title <a href="http://www.brainfuel.tv/coldfusion">Is Coldfusion Dead?</a> (Note: I swear that&#8217;s what the title was; even it&#8217;s changed now, but I could be wrong). I chimed in of course, but one other comment stuck with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You guys are in your own little world of open-source/9rules love.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it&#8217;s true! Not to put down anyone in the 9rules/open source/rails community, but as a note of just how far from the popular culture the Coldfusion blogosphere is. There are a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of coldfusion bloggers, just check out the <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com">Macromedia Weblogs List</a> . If i had to give a turning point of when I went from being a regular Coldfusion programmer, to a more advanced one I&#8217;d say the interest started right there. I started reading all the Coldfusion feeds I could find, started removing Rails feeds from Google Reader and yes, starting this blog. So with that said, I was happy to see my name on the <a href="http://9rules.com/blog/2006/12/new-additions-12-29-06-the-end/">last list of 9Rules entries</a> for the year! Hopefully I can bring a little more exposure to Coldfusion and Flex to the rest of the programming world without getting too deep into the Coldfusion world where things stop making since to outsiders. It&#8217;s also very humbling to be a very small group of programming blogs on 9Rules which I held in such high regard.</p>]]></content>

    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/reading-list-74</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been negligent to my web projects in exchange for spending time reading. Unfortunately the distractions of blogs, digg, email and daily life have made this a slower process than I initially planned, but understanding how much time is spent on these things is the first step towards changing it. A while ago I moved my television out of the computer room, and I noticed an increase in my productivity. Similarly there&#8217;s a room in the house now that has no television or computer which can be an excellent reading room. It&#8217;s almost sad to think the time we spend as little kids watching TV repeating in this day with time spent repeatedly checking <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds, Digg, Slashdot and email. One of my new years resolutions (which I&#8217;m slowly phasing in) is to try to limit this unproductive online time. First step is to thin out my Google Reader down from it&#8217;s unmanageable 89 feeds (!). Not too many have daily postings, but <a href="http://lifehacker.com">LifeHacker</a> , <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCruch</a> , <a href="http://slashdot.org">SlashDot</a> and <a href="http://joel.reddit.com">Joel.Reddit.com</a> are definitely staying on. What&#8217;s on my reading list right now?</p>
<h3>Head First Design Patterns</h3>
<p><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/design_patterns.jpg" class="left" alt="" /> This is one of the best written programming books I have ever read, and has made me a true believer in O&#8217;Reily&#8217;s Head First series. The main feature of this series of books is that they put emphasis not on having a reference book, but on you learning the topics down cold. In the introduction there is a description of studies done on how people learn- &#8211; through multiple ways. This series uses this combination of ways to both drive topics into peoples minds and keep readers interested. I can&#8217;t remember a time when I was looking forward to reading a technical book (well yeah, maybe Pragmatic Programmer).</p>
<h3><span class="caps">UML</span> Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/UML-Distilled-Standard-Modeling-Language/dp/0321193687/sr=1-2/qid=1165736128/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/uml.jpg" class="right" alt="" /></a> Getting into <span class="caps">OOP</span>, <span class="caps">UML</span> seemed the logical choice to study up on next. Some of the diagrams in Head First Design Patterns would have been more clear to me with the _ shared language_ or <span class="caps">UML</span>.</p>
<h3>Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design: A Brain Friendly Guide to Ooa&amp;d</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Object-Oriented-Analysis-Design/dp/0596008678/sr=1-1/qid=1165736369/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/oo_design.jpg" class="left" alt="" /></a> Along the same lines as above, but another take on it. I probably would have read this first, but I&#8217;d already started <span class="caps">UML</span> Distilled before I knew of this one.</p>
<h3>Code Complete</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Second-Steve-McConnell/dp/0735619670/sr=1-1/qid=1165736860/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/code_complete.jpg" class="right" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Along with Pragmatic Programmer and Joel on Software, this is one that I hear being recommended for programmers by a variety of people. Really looking forward to this one.</p>
<h3>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420/sr=1-12/qid=1165737052/ref=sr_1_12/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books"><img src="http://adamfortuna.com/media/books/patterns_architecture.jpg" class="left" alt="" /></a> Sadly I started this book before getting distracted with Head First Patterns. I&#8217;ve enjoyed Martin Fowlers style of writing though, so this and <span class="caps">UML</span> design are both fun reads. If I&#8217;m still impressed when I finish them I might dive into MF&#8217;s Refactoring as well.</p>
<p>Some of these books directly apply to things I&#8217;m working on, but for the most part they are just general knowledge that&#8217;s beneficial. There are some more direct things to read though, like <a href="http://www.fusionauthority.com/">Fusion Authority</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Macromedia-ColdFusion-Certified-Developer-Study/dp/0321330110/sr=1-4/qid=1165737455/ref=sr_1_4/102-9962947-6835328?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books">Coldfusion MX 7 Study Guide</a> ( I want to get CF certified after all :). I&#8217;d love to read up more on Spring and Aspect Oriented programming too somewhere along the lines. In the end though, books are all just support, it&#8217;s what we do with the knowledge from them that&#8217;s important, so I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll work in some programming time along the way as well.</p>]]></content>
