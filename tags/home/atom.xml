    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever seen pictures of the crazy work environments at &ldquo;Pixar&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.officesnapshots.com/category/pixar/">http://www.officesnapshots.com/category/pixar/</a> or &ldquo;Google&rdquo;:<a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/01/inside-google-office-videos-and.html">http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/01/inside-google-office-videos-and.html</a> you&rsquo;ll notice that most offices/cubes are cluttered, but people obviously get a lot done there. Well, IZEA decided it was time to bring a little of that creative clutter into the office and is having it&rsquo;s own cube design content- &ndash; &ldquo;Cubico Loco!&rdquo;:<a href="http://community.izea.com/blog/2008/07/izeas-cubico--1.html">http://community.izea.com/blog/2008/07/izeas-cubico--1.html</a> . The contest brought in many more themes than I would&rsquo;ve guessed including a video games cube, a stripper pole and a champagne room (complete with condom dispenser).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of &ldquo;pictures&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/payperpost/sets/72157605942033426/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/payperpost/sets/72157605942033426/</a> thanks to the camera-fiends at IZEA. When it comes to creating a workspace though, would you want something fun (themed, cube toys, colorful) or would you favor a workspace that&rsquo;s purely functional? I decided to go with a fun but functional setup for my workspace, putting up something that could stay up year round. The theme? &ldquo;Flying Spaghetti Monster!&rdquo;:<a href="http://flyingspaghettimonster.com/">http://flyingspaghettimonster.com/</a> Marilyn and I were able to create a little FSM plushie, along with a blowup of the famous &ldquo;noodly creation&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.venganza.org/images/wallpapers/noodlycreation.jpg">http://www.venganza.org/images/wallpapers/noodlycreation.jpg</a> drawing. There are a few bits of pirate memorabilia, some random pasta, FSM stickers and such, and of course the gospel sitting high.</p>

<p>Of course this goes against my &ldquo;home office setup&rdquo;:<a href="http://www.adamfortuna.com/2008/02/03/new-office-setup/">http://www.adamfortuna.com/2008/02/03/new-office-setup/</a> . It&rsquo;s the very definition of a functional office. It makes a more sense to have that kind of setup at home to me, while keeping the office space more fun. If your work is lacking some decorations, I&rsquo;d definitely suggest holding a similar contest. I also like the idea of a &ldquo;public vote for the winner&rdquo;:<a href="http://community.izea.com/blog/2008/07/izeas-cubico--1.html">http://community.izea.com/blog/2008/07/izeas-cubico--1.html</a> , which will be factored in with interoffice votes for the winner. Please vote! It doesn&rsquo;t have to be mine of course, but more votes can&rsquo;t hurt. There&rsquo;s plenty of great cubes better and more deserving than one worshiping and parody deity of a religion. :)</p>
