    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my annual recap of what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last year. It was a packed year &mdash; even without world changing events. Instead things were consistently active, busy and varied.</p>

<p>The biggest themes for my year were: Code School, travel, audiobooks, learning Angular and using a todo list (off and on) to organize my time. I also noticed that since I like to try to do new things, giving them a try in an easier (and perhaps cheaper) way is beneficial &mdash; that way I can fail fast if it&rsquo;s not a fit.</p>

<h2>So What&rsquo;s this All About?</h2>

<p>For the last few years, I&rsquo;ve tried to take a little time to look back at the previous year and made some goals for the next year (with limited success). Either way, it&rsquo;s interesting to both look back, and to add focus for the coming year. It&rsquo;s too easy for me to get blinders on to everything else in life and miss some of the bigger picture type of self evaluation that is worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>The first 6 months of the year &mdash; or really the 3 month stretch from April to June &mdash; was crazy. Japan, New York, Jacksonville, Chicago. These trips were awesome, but had the unfortunate side effect of knocking me off any exercise schedule I tried to get on. Even still, this year had some seriously amazing trips I won&rsquo;t soon forget.</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>I already want to go back to Japan.</p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Fulfilled a lifelong goal and went to <a href="/japan">Japan</a> for 2 weeks with Marilyn.</li>
<li>Went to <a href="http://2014.empirejs.org/">Empire.js</a> in New York with some of the Code School team.</li>
<li>Amelia Island (by Jacksonville) for <a href="http://jsconf.com/">JSConf</a>, which was probably my favorite dev conference ever. Also gave my first every conference talk there.</li>
<li>Chicago with Marilyn for the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2870708/">Wish I Was Here</a> KickStarter launch and finally seeing the city.</li>
<li>St. Petersburg for Crab Fest!</li>
<li>St. Pete Beach for the Code School Retreat</li>
<li>Currently planning a two week trip to Rome and Amsterdam for January.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Events and Entertainment</h2>

<p>We didn&rsquo;t end up going to many concerts this year, instead sticking to movies and a growing number of TV shows. I heard the term &ldquo;Golden Age of Television&rdquo; quite a few times this past year.</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>The code for my books page (Angular + Rails) is on <a href="https://github.com/adamfortuna/scribe">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Saw a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/list/top-10-films-of-2014/">load of movies</a>, my favorites for the year being: Intersteller, Edge of Tomorrow and The Wind Rises.</li>
<li>Missed Megacon for my first time in 18 years. :( Heard it was crazy this year though.</li>
<li>Lots of <a href="/books/#/?readAfter=2014-01-01&amp;readBefore=2015-01-01">audiobooks</a> &mdash; 42 total for the year. Top author was <a href="/books/#/?author=Brandon%20Sanderson&amp;readAfter=2014-01-01&amp;readBefore=2015-01-01">Brendon Sanderson</a>. Favorite books were <a href="/books/#/books/030788743X">Ready Player One</a>, <a href="/books/#/books/0812993012">Creativity Inc</a>, <a href="/books/#/books/0765326353">The Way of Kings</a> and <a href="/books/#/books/0765316994">Redshirts</a>.</li>
<li>The TV Shows I looked forward to most this year were Downton Abbey, Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Fargo and True Detective.</li>
<li>Went to BarCampOrlando and gave my JSConf talk there.</li>
<li>Saw Weezer&rsquo;s Blue Album performed live at Hard Rock.</li>
<li>Saw a couple basketball games and the new arena here in Orlando.</li>
<li>Did not play many video games this year. Mario Kart Wii U was at the top of the list, with Destiny and Elder Scrolls Online in the running.</li>
<li>Listened to Belle and Sebastian perform at House of Blues from a comfy balcony seat.</li>
<li>Saw a number of shows at Orlando Fringe including Escape from Baldwin Park, Sharknami: The Musical and Something&rsquo;s Weird in Weeki Wachi.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Fitness</h2>

<p>Continued doing CrossFit this year. Went often during the first few months, then less after traveling upset my schedule. For a while I was going 4x a week, but lately it&rsquo;s been closer to 2. In the new year I plan to get back on a consistent 3x schedule.</p>

<p><div class='pull-left '><p><img src="/images/2-years-of-crossfit/kingspoint.png" alt="CrossFit Kings Point" class="icon" /></p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Went to an Olympic Lifting class at the gym for a few months, which helped my form on cleans (175), snatches (125), deadlifts (300) and front squats (225) a ton.</li>
<li>Continued <a href="/2-years-of-crossfit">CrossFit</a> usually around 3 times a week, nearly always at 8am. Moved to going to Kings Point West most the time, which gives me an extra 30 minutes to my days.</li>
<li>Participated in the CrossFit Open and did much better than last year. I hadn&rsquo;t run all the numbers, but I think I was in the ~30th percentile (up from ~10th). I didn&rsquo;t do the last workout because I was in Japan though.</li>
<li>Continued doing yoga at work on Wednesdays. Great way to relax and prevent injury.</li>
<li>Did <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000881.html">Murph</a> in 50:10 for Memorial Day. Really wanted to get under 50 minutes. Maybe next year!</li>
<li>Participated in a local competition within our gym and got 4th place in the &ldquo;non-rx&rdquo; category. I&rsquo;m always amazed I can go head to head with people that are so strong, but luckily I get an advantage in the bodyweight exercise department.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Work</h2>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>Work mantra: “Will this make people happy?”</p>
</div></p>

<p>Officially switched from working at <a href="http://envylabs.com">Envy Labs</a> to <a href="https://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a> &mdash; even if that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d been doing already. My main focus has been on building an amazing, happy team that works well together and creates amazing things.</p>

<p><div class='pull-left '><p><img src="/images/codeschool/ember.png" alt="Warming Up With Emberjs" /></p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Released the 2nd half of the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs">Warming up with Ember.js</a> course. The creator of the framework even said it was awesome! At JSConf, I heard Ember core team members recommending it, which was pretty damn awesome. :)</li>
<li>Helped release a ton of Code School courses over the last year.</li>
<li>Created a number of internal tools &ndash; <a href="http://codeschool.github.io/abecedary/example/">Abecedary</a> (for running client-side code), Tutor (for running server side code), Projector (central store for videos), Guidance v2 (Pretty Charts with D3), Riddler (Challenge builder for courses).</li>
<li>Wrote the content for &ldquo;Blasting Off with Bootstrap&rdquo; and even presented in the videos! The course is coming out at the beginning of January.</li>
<li>Spent a lot of the year trying to build up an amazing team that works well with other teams. Got lucky in having some amazing people come on board to an already great team.</li>
<li>Was inspired a lot by Creativity Inc to change my mindset for managing from &ldquo;Get courses out&rdquo; to &ldquo;Make the team happier&rdquo;. I like how it has helped shape my decisions and make me personally happier as well.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Personal</h2>

<p><div class='pull-left '><p><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00HYAL84G.01.ZTZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="Fuji XT-1" /></p>
</div></p>

<p>In a year with a lot of new things at work, travel and fitness, there was a lot more focus on those specific areas, leaving this general &ldquo;personal&rdquo; category relatively bare. Of all the categories, this one had the last personal growth over the past year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stopped going to Piano lessons. It&rsquo;s still one of those things I&rsquo;d love to learn, but man, it&rsquo;s going to be an investment of time I&rsquo;m not willing to make at the moment.</li>
<li>Started learning photography and picked up a <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t1/">Fuji XT-1</a>. Amazing camera with physical dials for most functionality.</li>
<li>Didn&rsquo;t do too much personal programming this year, instead focusing on Code School stuff. One goal for next year will be having more personal projects to drive learning and creativity.</li>
<li>Revamped my <a href="/books">books</a> page to use Angular. Slowly adding some D3 to it as well.</li>
<li>Spent lots of time researching for the various places we traveled this year.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d been using <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> for a while off and on, but started using it, as well as calendars in general, much much more this year.</li>
<li>Started making more interesting cocktails at home, with my favorite spirits being Chartreuse, Gin and Mezcal.</li>
<li>Did a clean reformat of my Mac for the first time in 7 years.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Great Meals</h2>

<p>I tend to remember amazing meals far longer than I probably should. Here&rsquo;s a few that stand out. We gave Cask and Larder a few shots this year but wasn&rsquo;t impressed by any of them unfortunately. Luckily Ravenous Pig is always solid.</p>

<ul>
<li>Breakfast and dinner in the room at our Ryokan in Hakone, Japan.</li>
<li>Early morning Sushi at Tsukiji Market in Tokyo.</li>
<li>Ramen at a number of amazing places in Tokyo including Ippudo and somewhere in Harajuku.</li>
<li>Pastrami and Corned Beef at Carnegie Deli.</li>
<li>Amazing Ramen at Momofuku Noodle Bar.</li>
<li>Possibly the best meal of my life at Momofuku Ko.</li>
<li>Ravenous Pig for some amazing Trout and Venison.</li>
<li>Stone Crab Festival in St. Pete with Nate and so many friends.</li>
<li>Food and Wine Festival with the Code School gang.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say these are resolutions exactly &mdash; I&rsquo;m not planning on changing behavior on a dime on January first. Instead these are more goals to work towards in the new year that might change as my interests and focus change:</p>

<p>Get back on my old schedule of going to the gym 3x a week and eating a little better. I got out of this habit this year due to a lot of changes in my schedule, but I want to make sure I stick to it.</p>

<p>Keep learning about photography. I&rsquo;m still completely new to it, with a lot to learn, but it&rsquo;s been fun so far.</p>

<p>Continue keeping track of what I&rsquo;m working on using Things. This has been very helpful for pushing me to get a little more done. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it adds stress to my life, but instead relieves it by helping to prioritize things much better.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s about it. 2014 has been a fun year.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[The Audiobook Habit]]></title>
    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/audiobooks/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-14T12:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/audiobooks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are so many (good) podcasts out there it&rsquo;s easy to get swept away by them. About 2 years ago I was subscribing to over 30 of them, many of them news that overlapped with each other. Around this time, I decided to take a break from podcasts and binge listen to all 5 Game of Thrones books. For reference, that&rsquo;s over 200 hours of content.</p>

<p>After about 2 month of audiobooks, I switched back to podcasts and found I was able to unsubscribe from nearly everything and wonder why I listened to many of them in the first place. After that, what I listened to changed dramatically &mdash; focusing on storytelling, education and entertainment rather than news.</p>

<p>Stopping this deluge of information in podcast form was similar to when I stopped reading RSS feeds (thanks Google Reader for going away!). It was information I didn&rsquo;t know I didn&rsquo;t need.</p>

<h2>Habit Forming</h2>

<p>I have a tendency to take things to the extreme. Why do something if you&rsquo;re not going to go all the way? Marilyn knows that whenever we&rsquo;re watching a TV show, we&rsquo;re not going to just watch one episode, we&rsquo;re going to watch the entire series from episode 1, in order.</p>

<p>This same tendency that can cause a lot of wasted time when listening to podcasts, actually helps out for marathoning audiobooks. From when I wake up in the morning and roll out of bed, if I&rsquo;m not talking to someone, programming, reading or watching TV, I&rsquo;m probably listening to an audiobook. People around the office have no doubt seen me walking around with earbuds in. This resulted in 45 books in <a href="/books/#/?readAfter=2013-01-01&amp;readBefore=2014-01-01">2013</a> and 39 books (so far) in <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/?readAfter=2014-01-01&amp;readBefore=2015-01-01">2014</a>.</p>

<h3>Podcasts</h3>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>We started a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/wOq3osBzGu/">Cereal and Serial</a> listening club at work for the Serial Podcast.</p>
</div></p>

<p>I have missed out on some amazing podcasts in that time, and there are a few I&rsquo;ll still make sure to listen to. Freakanomics, RadioLab and Serial (for example) are all amazing, as well as too many others. Rather than tuning in each week for most of these (ie, all but Serial), I&rsquo;ll let them pile up then binge listen to 3-6 months of backlog in a few days. For other podcasts, I&rsquo;ll only pickout the episodes I like where they&rsquo;re touching on topics of interest, rather than listening to every episode regardless.</p>

<p>Seems obvious enough to do this, but when you&rsquo;re the habit of watching every episode of a TV show, skipping an episode of a podcast seems like you&rsquo;re not getting the full picture.</p>

<h2>Positive Implications</h2>

<p>What did this change have on my life? It wasn&rsquo;t immediately apparent, but a few things stand out. By tuning out tech gadget podcasts, I noticed my consumerist tendencies declined. By stopping some of the financial podcasts, I worried about investments less which resulted in less shifting money around and ultimately a more successful <a href="http://www.bogleheads.org/">Bogleheads</a> style strategy. By not tuning in on specific days each week for news, I had a less structured listening schedule where I wasn&rsquo;t immediately listening to whatever was available, and instead choosing what to listen to.</p>

<p><div class='pull-left '><p><a href="/books/#/books/0812993012"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0812993012.01.ZTZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="Creativity Inc" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><em>Creativity Inc</em>, 2014
</p>
</div></p>

<p>Listening around the house has helped me stay on track while getting things done. My entire garage was reorganized during a listen of <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/0380508567">Foundation</a>. <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/1583333894">Unstuff your Life</a> kickstarted a house cleanup that still proud of. <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/0812993012">Creativity Inc</a> began an amazing conversation at Code School that resulted in some effective changes to the way we work. <a href="http://adamfortuna.com/books/#/books/0307352145">Quiet: The Power of Introverts</a> was a interesting look at what gives me energy and helps drive me (and is a book I wish I had been able to read in middle school).</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>The drive for additional data on what I was reading led to the creation of an Ember.js Application for managing them, as well as a Code School course on what I learned building it. Lately, my obsession has been AngularJS, and I have learned a huge amount re-implementing it in the new framework. The next step is some crazy data visualizations using D3, which I&rsquo;m exited to have some data available to experiment with. If anyone wants to hack on it with me, the code is public on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/adamfortuna/scribe">adamfortuna/scribe</a>.</p>

<p>The inspiration for the books app was inspired by a few fellow programmers who have done the same. <a href="http://sivers.org/book">Derek Sivers</a> tracks what he&rsquo;s read, and tends to read business and personal improvement books. <a href="http://www.pamelafox.org/readinglist">Pamela Fox</a>, a fellow programmer in the education space, also tracks her books (we share a distaste for Neuromancer). Any other programmers out there do the same?</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<p><div class='pull-left '><p><a href="/books/#/books/0553283685"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0553283685.01.ZTZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="Hyperion" /></a>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><em>Hyperion</em>, 1989
</p>
</div></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for recommendations, the easiest thing is to checkout which books I&rsquo;ve rated as 5-star on <a href="http://goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> using the handy <a href="/books/#/?rating=5">books</a> page. 3 Books I recommend to everyone (although completely different in nature) are <a href="/books/#/books/030788743X">Ready Player One</a>, <a href="/books/#/books/0553283685">Hyperion</a> and <a href="/books/#/books/0765326353">The Stormlight Archive Series</a> (the last being the Fantasy equivalent of Game of Thrones &mdash; minus the sex).</p>

<p>On a side note, many thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/adamrensel">Adam Rensel</a> for the continued amazing book recommendations! If anyone else has suggestions, I&rsquo;m all ears. Lately I&rsquo;ve been eying the <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/11/139085843/your-picks-top-100-science-fiction-fantasy-books">NPR Top 100 Scienve Fiction and Fantasy</a> list as a good reference point, as well as <a href="/images/books/nprtop100.jpg">this amazing visualization</a> of which ones to focus on. The <a href="/books">books</a> page also shows what I&rsquo;m reading on the right, by tapping into GoodReads &ldquo;currently reading&rdquo; indicator.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Seeking Mentors]]></title>
    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/seeking-mentors/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-11T22:07:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/seeking-mentors</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I stumbled upon an interesting blog post about <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2014/01/07/how-to-be-a-mentor/">How to Be a Mentor</a> that included a variety of great advice on the subject. It occurred to me how many tips I could take and also how many mentors I&rsquo;ve sought out in just the past year or two.</p>

<h2>Fitness</h2>

<p>One of the major advantages to something like <a href="/2-years-of-crossfit">CrossFit</a> is the personalized coaching. Getting a training session with an extremely experienced trainer 3-5 times a week isn&rsquo;t something that seems unusual. More days than not I start the day with a challenge from Mike, Josh or Jason.</p>

<h3>Olympic Lifting</h3>

<p>Recently I started attending an Olympic Lifting class at the gym, with a focus on a few select movements &mdash; clean, jerk, front squat and snatch. The coach for it, <a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/about/about-the-trainers/">Mike Koenig</a> has been an amazing trainer over the last 2 years I&rsquo;ve been working with him, and I&rsquo;m excited to see how the added emphasis on these lifts helps my progress.</p>

<h3>Yoga</h3>

<p>Another unlikely addition to my fitness regime over the past year has been adding in a dash of yoga. Every Wednesday at Envy Labs, we push the ping pong table aside and do a yoga session. <a href="http://www.orlandopoweryoga.com/orlando-power-yoga-instructors.php">Courtney Singleton</a> has been an amazing instructor at easing me into the yoga world, in a non-sweaty introductory way that has helped my flexibility, and surely my performance in other fitness aspects as well.</p>

<p>After I strained my ankle a little over a year ago, yoga was one form of exercise that felt best for it. By Wednesday I&rsquo;m somewhat sore from working out, so having yoga mid week has helped as a recovery tool.</p>

<h3>Running</h3>

<p>Around the office, it&rsquo;s been <a href="http://happymediumblog.com/">Aimee Simone</a> who has continually helped bring people together for runs &ndash; often around downtown Orlando. The path around Lake Eola is a beautiful run, and this time of year it&rsquo;s something to take advantage of. Aimee also spearheaded the Yoga initiative which is always accepting new members.</p>

<h2>Piano</h2>

<p>Growing up, I remember going to my flute lessons in my karate gi. I didn&rsquo;t play flute for too long, maybe 2 or 3 years, but left always wanting to play piano. My dad was always an inspiration to me in the area of music. Throughout my early years, the house was filled with piano or guitar strings, which I came to love waking up to.</p>

<p>Last year I decided to take the plunge and buy an electric piano and find myself a teacher. I&rsquo;d put this off for quite a while mostly because I know it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;ll happen overnight. For the last year I&rsquo;ve been attending classes with <a href="http://www.gardenmusiconline.com/">Al</a> at Winter Garden Music near my house. Al&rsquo;s the kind of guy who you&rsquo;d give any piece of music to and he&rsquo;ll play through it verbatim on the first run through. With his help and encouragement, I&rsquo;m slowly improving, but I have a long ways to go.</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>When it comes to programming, there&rsquo;s something you can learn from everyone you meet, so it&rsquo;s impossible to list out any kind of complete list of mentors. My coworkers at Envy Labs push me to learn, teach and grow, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/eallam">Eric Allam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/caike">Carlos Souza</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/greggpollack">Gregg Pollack</a>.</p>

<p>Not all mentors are as hands on as the in person list above. Some mentors are idea creators and code writers who you interact with through the product of their work. Ever since stumbling on <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a> and <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">Learnable Programming</a>, I&rsquo;ve been following (stalking?) <a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a>. I&rsquo;m reasonably sure it&rsquo;s normal to have Google Alerts setup for whenever his name is mentioned.</p>

<p>Working at <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> and always trying to push the envelope when it comes to how we teach, just seeing these kinds of inspirational ideas helps immensely. Following the specific approaches Bret mentions isn&rsquo;t the important takeaway, but attempting to understand a concept from a students perspective and giving the tools for them to feel powerful when learning is an important goal to strive for.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still working my way through his lengthly list of <a href="http://worrydream.com/Links2013/">Links 2013</a>, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading all of them.</p>

<h2>Seeking Mentors</h2>

<p>One interest I mentioned in my <a href="/2013-year-in-review">2013 Year In Review</a> post was my desire to dive deeper into the JavaScript world. Part is this is reading through more JavaScript code by other people. If you&rsquo;re reading this and come across any interesting JavaScript code or blog posts the year, feel free send them my way. If for no other reason than it&rsquo;s more material to cover on the <a href="http://five-js.envylabs.com/">5 Minutes of JavaScript</a> podcast Carlos and I have been releasing every Thursday.</p>

<p>Seeking out mentors doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Finding programming mentors may be difficult outside of the workplace, but most people I talk are more than willing to guide people &ndash; just no one asks. If you respect someone and want advice, don&rsquo;t be shy to ask them.</p>

    <link href="http://adamfortuna.com/2013-year-in-review/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/2013-year-in-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my annual recap of what&rsquo;s happened in my life over the last year. I&rsquo;ve come to realize every 5th or 6th year is extremely active, while the other years seem to be less so. This year was not one of those 5/6 years, but instead more about personal growth and finding balance in my life. The biggest parts of my life this year were: Marilyn, Code School, CrossFit, audiobooks, learning Ember.js, and learning Piano.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t travel all that much this year. The biggest trips were Rails Conf and WWDC &ndash; both week long conferences attended with coworkers.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://railsconf.com/">Rails Conf</a> in Portland, OR</li>
<li>Was extremely lucky to attend <a href="/wwdc">WWDC</a> in San Francisco</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/365957862113021952">Sanibel</a> with Marilyn for her birthday weekend</li>
<li>Went to Miami for <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/404414324401520641">Distant Worlds</a>, a Final Fantasy Concert</li>
</ul>


<h2>Events and Entertainment</h2>

<p>The most random event this year was Distant Worlds. Marilyn and I were discussing &ldquo;What musical acts would you absolutely love to see that you haven&rsquo;t?&rdquo; and I mentioned Nobuo Uematsu, the composer behind the Final Fantasy games. After looking to see if he had a tour coming up, there was one in Miami 2 months out. Considering he&rsquo;s only performed in the US 10 times in 10+ years, we really lucked out!</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>If you like movies, I’d encourage you to create a <a href="http://letterboxd.com/">Letterboxd</a> account and friend me!</p>
</div></p>

<ul>

<h2>Body</h2>

<p>2011 was about having fun and keeping interested (when it comes to CrossFit). This year was more about testing my limits and seeing how I could improve. Towards the end of the year I did start to plateau when it comes to working out. I suspect it was due to an awful diet and lack of sleep.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/2-years-of-crossfit">Worked out</a> usually around 3 or 4 times a week, nearly always at 8am</li>
<li>Stopped by <a href="http://www.crossfitportland.com/">CrossFit Portland</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/yeabuddy">Casey</a> when in town for Rails Conf</li>
<li>Participated in the <a href="http://evaleverything.com/2013/11/12/xkcd-style-graphs-with-r/">CrossFit Open</a> with a few other people to see how I matched up. My best performance was in the 20% percentile, but most were in the 4%</li>
<li>Continued doing yoga at work on Wednesdays. Great way to relax and prevent injury</li>
<li>Did <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/000881.html">Murph</a> in 51:17 for Memorial Day. Confident I can do better next time!</li>
<li>Ran in a <a href="https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/297775932167553024">Warrior Dash</a> outside of Orlando with a few friends. Muddy and cold, but a load of fun</li>
<li>Running around Lake Eola in downtown Orlando after work occasionally when not too hot out</li>
</ul>


<p><div class='pull-right '><p>The FitBit is awesome, but it doesn’t understand how much I hate wall balls.</p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Got a FitBit for Christmas, with the hope of monitoring my sleep patterns and general fitness. When I keep track of things, they generally get better.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Work</h2>

<p>Worked at <a href="http://envylabs.com">Envy Labs</a> entirely on <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> all year long. My main focus has been on putting out awesome courses and trying to improve education through technology.</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>Work mantra: always ask “What Would Bret Victor Do?”</p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Changed job titles to &ldquo;Technical Director at Code School&rdquo;, whatever that means.</li>
<li>Helped released a ton of Code School courses over the last year. A total of 17 went out in 2013</li>
<li>Helped write and worked on <a href="http://try.jquery.com">Try jQuery</a>, a free way to learn jQuery in the browser (and linked to from the jQuery site). Followed up by writing <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/jquery-the-return-flight">jQuery: The Return Flight</a></li>
<li>Helped write the Ruby/JavaScript side of Code Schools <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/core-ios-7">Core iOS 7</a> course, which lead to a few <a href="http://evaleverything.com/2013/10/04/teaching-ios-7-at-codeschool/">blog posts</a> about it</li>
<li>Wrote and helped implement <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs">Warming up with Emberjs</a>, a course to learn Ember.js from scratch. Basing the implemention on everything we&rsquo;d learned about teaching programming in the browser.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Great Meals</h2>

<p>I tend to remember amazing meals far longer than I probably should. Here&rsquo;s a few that stand out.</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>Having coffee at Victoria &amp; Alberts is a magical experience.</p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Went to <a href="http://victoria-alberts.com/">Victoria &amp; Alberts</a> restaurant with Marilyn for our Anniversary</li>
<li>Had a great birthday dinner with Cask and Larder with Marilyn, my Dad and Paige</li>

<li>Had Marilyns Birthday dinner at Pharmacy with tons of friends</li>
<li>Stone Crab Festival in St. Pete with Nate and so many friends</li>
<li>Food and Wine Festival with the Envy Labs gang</li>
</ul>


<h2>Personal</h2>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>Seriously, the little girl in the Piano lesson after mine is soo much better than me.</p>
</div></p>

<ul>
<li>Bought an electric piano and started taking lessons every week. Still not very good, but making progress</li>
<li>Cleaned out and organized the garage and attic to where we actually know where things are</li>
<li>Launched a programming blog called <a href="http://evaleverything.com/">eval everything</a>, where I&rsquo;ve been writing about anything technical topics that are interesting</li>
<li>Updated this blog from it&rsquo;s previous setup!</li>
</ul>


<h2>Next Year</h2>

<p>Looks like I&rsquo;m in the <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/">45% of people who make New Years resolutions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Continue learning piano</strong>. For me this means doing more practice at home as well as keeping up with lessons.</p>

<p><strong>Get into Angular.js development</strong>, which we&rsquo;re using for a new Code School project. Kind of have to do this one for work anyways, but I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do it too.</p>

<p><strong>Get more into JavaScript testing frameworks</strong> out there. I&rsquo;ve let my JavaScript go untested for far too long.</p>

<p><strong>Invite friends over more</strong>, typically to play games or anything really. Too many times this year we said &ldquo;we need to have a game night&rdquo;. If you ever want to have a game night, just let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Keep track of things more</strong>. Kind of an obvious one, but &ldquo;What gets measured gets improved&rdquo; has always been true for me. I&rsquo;m already doing these &mdash; some all the time, some intermittently.</p>

<ul>
<li>My Todo list in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a></li>
<li>Workouts and fitness goals in Evernote</li>
<li>Piano practice in Evernote</li>
<li>Audiobooks in my <a href="/books">book log</a></li>

    <id>http://adamfortuna.com/2-years-of-crossfit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of November 1st, I will have been doing <a href="http://crossfit.com/">CrossFit</a> for 2 years. What started as a casual twice a week workout, slowly grew up to four and sometimes even 5 workouts a week. It&rsquo;s been an amazing, life changing experience that I bring up in conversation entirely too often. 2 years seems like as good a time as any to reflect and detail my experience so far.</p>

<h2>Fitness Background</h2>

<p>Earlier in life I used to work out often. I had a good routine of jogging in the morning, and weight training after work a few days a week. This went well, but I didn&rsquo;t love it. This routine was thrown off when I changed jobs and I spent nearly 3 years doing absolutely nothing that required raising my heart rate.</p>

<p>That might have continued if not for my friend and coworker <a href="http://caseyjenks.com/">Casey Jenks</a> who co-founded <a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/">CrossFit Kings Point</a>. After a few months of hearing about this CrossFit thing, I decided to check it out.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>Box: Term for a local CrossFit affiliate</p>
</div></p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s say you want to try out CrossFit. What should you expect? Well, after joining a local box, there&rsquo;s a period where you&rsquo;re learning an entire new vocabulary and trying new movements every week. I started slow, at only 2 days a week. 2 days a week is better than 0, and getting a sustainable routine is an important step.</p>

</div></p>

<h3>Your First Day</h3>

<p><div class='pull-left '><p><img src="/images/2-years-of-crossfit/kingspoint.png" alt="CrossFit Kings Point" class="icon" /></p>
</div></p>

<p><a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/">CrossFit Kings Point</a> and most CrossFit gyms start people off with some type of &ldquo;On Ramp&rdquo; program. The way it currently works is you come in for your initial workout and you&rsquo;re paired with a trainer in a small class, possibly even alone, and taken through all the exercises for the day. A typical workout might look something like this:</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>EMOM: Every minute on the minute
AMRAP: As many rounds as possible</p>
</div></p>

<p><blockquote><p>Strength: Weighted Pull Ups<br/>3 x 3 x 3 x 3 x 3<br/>Rest 2 Minutes between Sets<br/>Or<br/>10 Minute EMOM of Muscle Ups<br/>(Based on your ability)</p></p><p><p>Then, 7 Minute AMRAP<br/>7 Burpees<br/>7 Pull-Ups<br/>7 Box Jumps (24/20)</p></blockquote></p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>WOD: Workout of the day</p>
</div></p>

<p>Going into your first day can be intimidating, but having someone there walk you through it can be amazing for getting started. For something like this, you&rsquo;ll learn about the structure of the workout &mdash; namely that there will be a skill portion where you&rsquo;re moving slow but working on strength, followed by a WOD where you you&rsquo;re moving fast for 7 minutes.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d learn about using bands for pullups which provide additional help if you&rsquo;re unable to do body weight pull ups. The trainer would also walk you through the individual movements, showing you what it means to do a burpee, a pull-up and a box jump.</p>

<p>Every gym has a different way of introducing new members to fitness, so check out how the gym near you structures your first days and weeks.</p>

<h3>My First Day</h3>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>CrossFit has many named workouts that you can use as a benchmark for your progress.</p>
</div></p>

<p>My first workout was a &ldquo;Half Cindy&rdquo;, which consisted of doing 5 pull-ups, 10 pushups and 15 squats in that series over and over for 10 minutes (an AMRAP). Even with the assistance of a band, I struggled to not throw up after 5 rounds. Even with that awkward feeling, it felt amazing. I scheduled my next workout immediately and didn&rsquo;t look back.</p>

<p>On a side note, wecently we did &ldquo;Cindy&rdquo;, which is the same workout, but over 20 minutes. I managed 17 rounds this time, without using a band. Amazing to be able to look back. Maybe in another year, that number will be 20 &mdash; or more?</p>

<h2>Avoiding Injuries</h2>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>Bouldering: Rock climbing on a wall no higher than 12ft without a rope.</p>
</div></p>

<p>In 2 years, I&rsquo;ve had 2 injuries, and only one was CrossFit related. I strained my ankle bouldering and couldn&rsquo;t run for a month. In that time I continued working out, but instead of running, I&rsquo;d row. Other ankle related movements, like squats, weren&rsquo;t a problem. Workouts can always be scaled back based on injuries if you make it clear with the trainer.</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>I’m not counting torn hands, bruises or scrapped knees as injuries.</p>
</div></p>

<p>My only CrossFit related injury was on such a light, simple movement, it&rsquo;s hard to believe it ended up with me not being unable to walk straight for 3 weeks. I was doing a stiff legged deadlift with a light 56 lb kettlebell as a warmup, and on the way up I heard my back crack. I knew right away something was wrong and I had to lay down and limit my movement right away. My trainer (Mike), insisted I sit out and stretch rather than participate in the workout. Within half an hour I could barely move without intense pain.</p>

<p>I managed to get it looked at that day, which lead to some pain medicine for it, followed by a massage. Luckily for me it was nothing serious &mdash; just a back strain. My back was a persistant spasmed state for a number of weeks, but I was able to return to working out after a week and a half off by adjusting the workouts for my limitations.</p>

<h2>Diet</h2>

<p>When it comes to diet, there&rsquo;s always two &mdash; what you aim for and what actually happens. I go through periods of focus with my diet, which generally lead to larger gains. Between them is my usual, mostly-healthy diet.</p>

<h3>Paleo</h3>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>There may or may not be shirtless before/after pictures of me for this Paleo Challenge.</p>
</div></p>

<p>For the month of August 2012, I participated in a &ldquo;<a href="http://crossfitkingspoint.com/paleo-challenge-results/">Paleo Challenge</a>&rdquo; competition run by my gym. The goal was to eat no grains, sugars, salt, vinegar, rice, chocolate &mdash; or other things considered non-paleo for the month. This generally meant eating meats, vegetables, fruits, nuts, olive oil and not much else. I cut out fruit as well to try to lower my sugar intake even lower.</p>

<p>The result of this was that I went down from 8.2% to 6.8% body fat over the course of a month. At 132lbs, that&rsquo;s almost surely the slimest I&rsquo;ll ever be in my life. At that rediculously small size, I didn&rsquo;t have any visible 6-pack. Genetics still plays a factor in something like that.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t follow paleo now, although I do tend to eat more meat and less sugar than the average person. Some things, like salt, are annoyingly difficult to limit, and the occasional beer/wine throughout the week is still an indulgence. The biggest takeaway from the paleo education is understanding how different foods affect my energy level, moods and training goals.</p>

<h3>Weight</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t talked about weight all that much because it hasn&rsquo;t been a goal of mine. Going into my first workout I weighed around 155lbs. My first 10 months ended up shedding 20lbs of that going three times a week. In the year since then, I&rsquo;ve managed to put that amount back on, mostly as muscle.</p>

<p>During this time, I&rsquo;ve never had a &ldquo;goal weight&rdquo;. Instead I&rsquo;ve aimed for periods of eating a caloric deficit, followed by periods of eating a surplus.</p>

<h2>Tracking Progress</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t plan on doing CrossFit at any kind of competitive level, but I do enjoy pushing myself and seeing improvements over time. I&rsquo;m securely in the &ldquo;intermediate&rdquo; tier on the arbitrary <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/cf-journal/WLSTANDARDS.pdf">CrossFit Strength Standards</a> document for my weight in all movements.</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>I really want to do something with the Evernote API for tracking personal bests, volume and progress.</p>
</div></p>

<p>For tracking my own progress, I create a new <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> note for each day, and tag it with each movement, and the name of the workout if there is one. Pulling up previous times and maxes on a given lift are as easy as looking at other notes with that tag. I&rsquo;ve been keeping a single <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s2/sh/973a96d9-aa87-47d3-9f85-04de242891a5/24a64823dbfba5d6f83e918706cbdf55">Max Lifts</a> note containing my current progress as a quick reference.</p>

<h3>The Open</h3>

<p>One other way of tracking progress is participating in The Open, the very base level of competition. The Open consists of 5 workouts that you perform at your local gym. Every athlete around the world performs the exact same workouts, with the same weights, which allows for a global ranking. The top 30ish in each region participate in &ldquo;Regionals&rdquo; where they do a few more workouts. The top 3 from each region then move on to &ldquo;The Games&rdquo;. This is the big event that&rsquo;s broadcast on ESPN each summer.</p>

<p>There is a huge thrill in being the same starting pool as those who go onto to The Games, even if it&rsquo;s a completely different level. It&rsquo;s similar to the US Open Golf tournament where anyone can participate, but the amazing thing about The Open is how many people join due to its distributed nature &mdash; 150,000.</p>

<p>For the last 2 years I participated, even though in both cases still a beginner. During the 2nd year I analyzed my progress and progress to compare against the field at large. The result? I was in somewhere between the 4% and 21% percentile for all of the workouts. I&rsquo;m already looking forward to seeing how I compare next year!</p>

<h2>Finding Friends</h2>

<p>One of the biggest surprises about starting CrossFit was making so many friends. After 2 years at LA Fitness, the longest conversation I had with anyone was &ldquo;Are you done here?&rdquo;. At the gym I go to, there are other regulars at the 8am class I attend, which has lead to meeting smart and driven people that I wake up to each day. That&rsquo;s not to mention the amazing trainers who help shape your progress and provide inspiration.</p>

<p>Being a developer and tending to find myself at developer events and developer conferences, spending time with people outside my profession has refreshing. The group I&rsquo;ve come to know includes trainers, chefs, salespeople, flight attendants, former gymnists, students, parents, and too many more to list. Ages range dramatically from teens up to 60s and higher. During many, if not most classes, there are more women than men.</p>

<p><div class='pull-right '><p>Worth every penny.</p>
</div></p>

<p>Tim Dikun, a coworker, friend and fellow CrossFitter, mentioned the biggest diversity gap in his <a href="http://timdikun.com/journal/2013/02-crossfit-year-in-review/">CrossFit Year in Review</a> post: income. CrossFit isn&rsquo;t cheap. While a month at 24h Fitness is $10, a month at a CrossFit gym will run somewhere around $150/month or more.</p>

<h2>Try It Out!</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trying out CrossFit, don&rsquo;t be intimidated. Everyone is a beginner at some point and knows what it feels like. I&rsquo;ve never talked to anyone at the gym that didn&rsquo;t greet me with smiles.</p>
