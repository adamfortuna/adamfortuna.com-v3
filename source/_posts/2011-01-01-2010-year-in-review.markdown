As for new years resolutions? Probably increase savings a bit more, eat a little healthier and spend less time on the couch. Like to eat out less and get better at creating the things I love to eat and drink from scratch including salad dressing, sauces and brewing beer- - and maybe later on wine. If there's one thing I want to do in 2011 though, it'd be launch the site I'm working on in my spare time, and do it right.
