My yearly recap of what's happened in my life over the last year. I've come to realize every 5th or 6th year is extremely active, while the other years seem to be less so. This year was not one of those 5/6 years, but instead more about personal growth and finding balance in my life. The biggest parts of my life this year were: Marilyn, CrossFit, audiobooks, learning Ember.js, and learning Piano.

## Travel

- [Rails Conf](http://railsconf2013.com/) in Portland, OR
- [WWDC](/wwdc) in San Francisco
- [Sanibel](https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/365957862113021952) with Marilyn for her birthday weekend
- Miami for [Distant Worlds](https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/404414324401520641), a Final Fantasy Concert

## Events and Entertainment

* Saw a [load of movies](http://letterboxd.com/adamfortuna/year/2013/), my favorites for the year being: Somm, Gravity and Stoker
* Lots of [audiobooks](/audiobooks-2013) including Hyperion, more Orson Scott Card and a lot of Sci Fi
* The TV Shows I looked forward to most this year were Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, Homeland, Dexter and Breaking Bad
* The Postal Service concert viewed from the balcony at Hard Rock
* A hilarious Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine concert at House of Blues
* Saw Kevin Smith live at the Plaza Theater
* Food and Wine Festival with the Envy Labs gang
* Went to [BarCampOrlando](https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/335839768439029761) and presented on "R Programming for Ruby and Rails Developers"
* Lots of [Code School](http://codeschool.com) Beta events for new courses every month

## Body

Last year was about having fun and keeping interested (when it comes to CrossFit). This year was more about testing my limits and seeing how I could improve.

* [Worked out](http://crossfitkingspoint.com/) every week I was physically able to
* Participated in the [CrossFit Open](http://evaleverything.com/2013/11/12/xkcd-style-graphs-with-r/) with a few other people to see how I matched up. My best performance was in the 20% percentile, but most were in the 4%.
* Continued doing yoga at work on Wednesdays. Great way to relax and prevent injury
* Ran in a [Warrior Dash](https://twitter.com/adamfortuna/status/297775932167553024) outside of Orlando with a few friends. Muddy and cold, but a load of fun
* Running around Lake Eola in downtown Orlando after work occasionally when not too hot out

## Work

Worked at [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com) entirely on [Code School](http://codeschool.com) all year long.

* Changed job titles to "Technical Director at Code School", whatever that means.
* Helped released a ton of Code School courses over the last year. A total of 17 went out in 2013
* Helped write and worked on [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com), a free way to learn jQuery in the browser (and linked to from the jQuery site). Followed up by writing [jQuery: The Return Flight](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/jquery-the-return-flight)
* Helped write the Ruby/JavaScript side of Code Schools [Core iOS 7](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/core-ios-7) course, which lead to some [blog posts](http://evaleverything.com/2013/10/04/teaching-ios-7-at-codeschool/) about it
* Wrote and helped implement [Warming up with Emberjs](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/warming-up-with-emberjs), a course to learn Ember.js from scratch. Basing the implemention on everything we'd learned about teaching programming in the browser.

### Personal

* Bought an electric piano and started taking lessons every week. Still not very good, but making progress
* Had a great birthday dinner with Cask and Larder with Marilyn, my Dad and Paige
* 

## Next Year

I'd like to continue learning piano. The little girl who has the lesson after me is still way ahead. Other then that get into Angular.js development, which we're using for a new Code School project. Also get more into JavaScript testing frameworks out there. Marilyn and I are planning on going on a trip to Japan in 2014, which should be a load of fun.
