eval everything is a blog by [Adam Fortuna][] serving as an outlet for writing about technical topics that many people in my life would be bored reading about on my [personal blog][]. I'm a developer at [Envy Labs][] working on [Code School][] and usually have at least a commit or two in on every course we release.

If you're curious what went into the design and setup of the site, you should checkout the post on [Designing eval everything][], or just [grab the source][].

At Code School, I work mostly on the course side of things. Most of us wear a lot of hats -- sometimes writing courses, sometimes implementing them. My main focus this year has included things like co-writing the content for [Try jQuery][] and [jQuery 2: The Return Flight][]. Lately I've been working a lot on the front end of courses, mostly with Backbone.js. We recently revamped it to make it easier to bring new ideas to light. Check out the first level of [Rails 4: Zombie Outlaws][] for an example.

Looking forward, my biggest technological areas of interest are Ember.js, D3, and iOS development. My spirit animal would be [Bret Victor][].
